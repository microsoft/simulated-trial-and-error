The study collected by the British National Centre for Languages for the EU leader, says over 10 per cent of 2,000 small and medium-sized   firms in 29 European countries sampled   in the study have lost export contract   because of lack of language skills. The study says French is used to trade with partners in Africa, Spanish in Latin America, and Russian in Eastern Europe. \"The picture is far more complex than the much-quoted view that English is the world language,\" the study says. Multilingual   Commissioner Leonard Orban admitted that English plays an important role worldwide, but he wants to improve more linguistic variety within the EU. The EU's linguistic headaches have exploded with the group's expansion. Languages have become a sensitive topic in Brussels where English is increasingly eclipsing   French as the main working language of the organization. Translation of EU papers into EU's 23 official languages costs 1 billion euros (US $1.31 billion) a year. \"We want to be open not only to official languages of the Union, but also to others like regional   languages, languages of minorities, immigrants'   languages and third countries' languages,\" Orband said.

Mr. Obama stressed the need for all participants to seek common ground to deal with the economic crisis.  \"I am  ly confident that this meeting will reflect enormous consensus about the need to work together to deal with these problems,\" said Mr. Obama. There are signs of tension, as the G20 summit prepares to begin its work in London.  Some countries are blaming the United States for sparking the economic crisis through the deregulation of its financial scene - a move that sparked an economic recession . The president says the United Stateshas made mistakes, but so did other countries whose regulatory systems could not keep pace with a changing financial sector. He says it is time to look for solutions. \"At this point, I am less interested in identifying blame, than in fixing the problem,\" he said. President says differences are overstated. France and Germanysay the emphasis should be on regulatory reform.  French President Nicholas Sarkozy even told an interviewer that he might walk out of the summit, if nations fail to agree on stricter regulation of global financial markets.

Article: From the beginning of human history, wild animals provided food, clothing and sometimes medicine. We may not depend as much on wild animals now. But we hear about them every day. Americans use the names of animals in many ways. Automobile manufacturers  and gasoline companies especially like to use big cats to sell their products. They like lions, tigers and wildcats. When Americans say wildcat, they usually mean _ . All these cats attack quickly and fiercely. So wildcats represent something fast and fierce. An early American use of the word wildcat was quite different. It was used to describe members of Congress  who declared war on Britain in 1812. A magazine of that year said the wildcat congressmen went home. It said they were unable to face the responsibility of having involved their country in an unnecessary war. Wildcat also has been used as a name for money in the 1800s. At that time, some states permitted banks to make their own money. One bank in the state of Michigan offered paper money with a picture of a wildcat on it. Some banks, however, did not have enough gold to support all the paper money they offered. So the money had little or no value. It was called a wildcat bill or a wildcat bank note. The banks who offered this money were called wildcat banks. A newspaper of the time said those were the days of wildcat money. It said a man might be rich in the morning and poor by night. Wildcat then was also used for an oil well or gold mine that had almost no oil or gold in it. Dishonest developers would buy such property. Then they would sell it and leave town with the money. The buyers were left with worthless holes in the ground. Today, wildcat oil wells are in areas that are not known to have oil. Question: It can be inferred that during the days of wildcat money  _  . - people couldn't buy anything with the money - people didn't know how to save money. - the rich invested too much on oil wells. - people complained and suffered a lot\n"}], "response": "people complained and suffered a lot"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Stanley, as a son of a very poor farmer, left school early and went to work in a factory, for education was for the rich then. So, the world became his school. With great interest, he read everything he could, listened to the town elders and learned about the world beyond his hometown. \"There's so much to learn,\" he'd say. \"Though we're born stupid, only the stupid remain that way.\" He decided that none of his children would be refused an education. Therefore, Stanley insisted that we should learn at least one new thing each day. Though, as children, we thought this was crazy, we'd still do _ . And dinner time seemed perfect for sharing what we learned. We would talk about the news of the day. Sometimes the news was unimportant, but it was always taken seriously. Stanley would listen carefully and discuss it with us. Then came the moment--the time to share the day's new learning. \"Felice,\" he'd say, \"tell me what you learned today.\" \"I learned that the population of Denmark is ....\" Silence. Stanley was thinking about what was said. \"The population of Denmark. Hmm. Well...\" he'd say. \"Get the map; let's see where Denmark is.\" And the whole family went on a search for Denmark. This same experience was repeated until each family member had a turn. Dinner ended only after we had a clear understanding of at least half a dozen such facts. As children, we thought very little about these educational wonders. Our family, however, was growing together, sharing experiences and joining in one another's education. And by looking at us, listening to us, respecting what we learned, confirming our value, Stanley was surely our most influential teacher. Later during my training as a future teacher, I studied with some of the most famous educators. They were imparting  what Stanley knew all along--the value of continual learning. His skills have served me well all my life. Not a single day has been wasted, though I can never tell when knowing the population of Denmark might prove useful.

Before you can take the test to earn your learner's privileges, you'll need to inform the state of your intent to receive your permit. Fill out a permit application with your personal information and return it to the DMV. Once you've taken care of the application process, you'll receive your study materials for the written driving test.  The permit application will ask for basic information, such as your full legal name, date of birth, home address, hair color, eye color, etc. Apply for your learner's permit online to save yourself a trip to the DMV office. The DMV will ask you to supply them with at least two forms of personal ID, one of them being your social security card. This usually means a birth certificate, social security card, passport or other recognized form of photo ID, although many different ID forms are accepted. Providing identification proves that you are who you say you are and confirms that you meet the minimum age requirement to test for your permit.  In most states in the US, you have to be at least 15 years old to get a driving permit. Only a handful of states, including Alaska, Arkansas and North and South Dakota, issues permits to prospective drivers as young as 14.  Bring your original birth certificate or passport and your social security card along in case the DMV in your state doesn't accept photocopies.  You will also need 2 pieces of mail verifying your correct address. You'll be asked to sit for a brief eyesight exam when applying for your learner's permit. The exact nature of the exam will vary, but you might be instructed to read letters of different sizes off a chart or identify gradually smaller shapes and details from a distance. The eye exam will let the DMV officials know that your eyesight is good enough for you to learn to operate a vehicle. If you don't perform satisfactorily on your eye exam, you might have to get corrective eyewear like glasses or contact lenses. A note will be made on your permit that you have to be wearing this eyewear while driving. While at the DMV, go ahead and pay whatever fees are required for testing and certification. There are sometimes separate fees involved for submitting an application, taking an eyesight exam and sitting for the written test. After all fees have been paid, you'll be able to schedule a date and time to take your test and receive your study materials.  Fees, along with testing requirements, may be different for each state. It's not cheap to get your learner's permit. Make an effort to pass your test the first time so you won't have to pay to apply and take it again.\nQuestion: What is a summary of what this article is about?\n"}], "response": "Study the requirements in your jurisdiction.

Article: For three days Mr Bunter did not say a word. He looked at people sensibly enough but seemed unable to hear any questions put to him. An officer remarked to the captain, \"Those brass   plates on the steps of the bridge-ladder are very dangerous things. \" \"Are they?\" replied Captain Johns, \"It takes more than a brass plate to make an able-bodied man fall down in that way. And the weather fine, everything dry, and the ship going on a smooth sea!\" On the fourth day, the chief officer looked better. He could hear and understand and could even speak in a weak voice.  \"Well, Mr Bunter,\" said Captain Johns, \"Can you tell us what caused the accident!\" Bunter moved his head slightly and fixed his cold blue stare on the Captain's eyes and said in a whisper, \"You--were--right!\" \"Bless my soul!\" cried out Captain Johns, \"Do you mean you had a supernatural experience that night? You saw a ghost on my ship?\" Unwillingness, shame, disgust   would have been seen on poor Bunter's face if a good part of it had not been wrapped in bandage   . He tried hard and answered, \"Yes, I have seen.\" \"And did it --did it knock you down from the ladder?\" \"Come! Am I the sort of man to be knocked down by a ghost?\" Captain Johns pointed a finger at Bunter. \"You've been terrified, \" he said , \"That's what's the matter, even the man at the wheel was frightened, though he couldn't see anything. He felt the supernatural. You've been punished because you wouldn't believe, Mr Bunter. \" \"Suppose I have, \" said Bunter, \"You don't know what I saw. And I can't tell you what it was like. Every man has his own ghosts. I stepped back. I don't remember anything else. \" \"The man at the wheel said you went backwards as if something had hit you.\" \"It was a sort of inward blow, \" Bunter explained, \"Aren't you satisfied now that I believe?\" Question: We can know from the story that   _  . Options: A: Mr Bunter had been punished because of his disbelief in ghost B: the ghost had hit Mr Bunter and he had fallen backwards C: Mr Bunter had somehow fallen down the bridge backwards D: Mr Bunter had hit himself against the brass plates on the steps of the bridge ladder\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Environmental health is defined as the control of the factors   in the environment that may have harmful effects on people's physical, mental, or social well-being  . Because natural disasters expose people to danger by bringing up or threatening their immediate environment, effective management of environmental health after a natural disaster is of great importance. The environmental health measures that must be considered after a natural disaster include the supply of appropriate shelter for individuals or groups of people left homeless, the distribution   of safe and accessible water, and the protection and distribution of safe food products and so on. To effectively manage environmental health during and after a disaster, it is important that a state of preparation is in effect before the event actually occurs. During an emergency, success largely depends on making good, rapid judgment and appropriate response measures. High-level decision makers, therefore, must be familiar with sound measures beforehand and should be given an accurate judgment of the disaster's specific effects as quickly as possible. This book is intended to serve as a guide for those who may be called upon to make emergency decisions after disaster strikes. The recommended environmental health measures have been listed in the order of priority in which they should be taken during an emergency. However, each natural disaster is unique in the degree or type of emergency. In response to any given disaster, decision makers may find it necessary to change the priority assigned to any particular measure. Question: In order to effectively cope with the emergency, the most important is that   _  . Options: A: we should have enough shelters and tools B: everyone should be familiar with the situation C: we should be well prepared for it in advance D: we can deal with it just as we did before\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Bill Fulton doesn't remember losing his wallet, but its return helped him remember the past. The leather stayed smooth and the cowboy design unblemished  . And when he looked inside, the contents brought back memories from 1946, when he apparently dropped the wallet behind the balcony bleachers   in the Baker Middle School gym. Fulton's Social Security Card and bicycle license, bearing the address where he lived during his teenage years, were positioned in their respective compartments, apparently untouched since the year after World War Il ended. Worker Nathan Osborne found the wallet -- along with old homework, lost library books and a 1964 talent show program -- while removing the bleachers for renovations on June 17. It was brought to Fulton's door the following day by Melanie Trindle, the Baker Middle School secretary. Middle School Principal Mindi Vaughan said the brown pine bleachers were connected to the gym balcony's brick wall and had remained in the same place since the school, known as the Helen M. Stack Building, opened in 1936. Fulton, 78, said he probably lost the wallet while cheering for the Baker High basketball team with a group of friends. Fulton said the bicycle ID was needed because he delivered medicine for Rodamar Drug. He was surprised, however, that his bicycle ID wasn't inside. He said he always kept it there. But rather than focus on what was inside the wallet, Fulton said the recovery has led him to reflect on his life -- one that took him to the Korean War and Berlin before the return to Baker City. He worked at Ellingson Lumber Company for 30 years, from March 1964 to April 1994. Since his retirement, Fulton has enjoyed spending time with his 11-year-old black dog, Smokey. The two often hike the nearby mountains. Trindle's knock on the door, wallet in hand, induced a slight ripple in his life, prompting him to consider the times he hadn't thought about in many years. \"Where did all the times go?\" Fulton said with a deep sigh. \"It' s hard to believe that the times have gone so fast.\" Question: When the wallet was found, it  _  .

(November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) An abandoned ship crashes into a dockyard in Brooklyn, New York, and the ship inspector, Silas Green, finds it full of corpses. Elsewhere, Julius Jones, Silas's nephew, has a run-in with some Italian mobsters. Just as the two goons are about to kill Julius, Maximillian, a suave, mysterious vampire (who arrived on the ship in his intricately carved coffin), intervenes and kills them. Soon after, Maximillian infects Julius with his vampiric blood, before Julius turning into a decaying ghoul and claiming that it has benefits; he then explains that he has come to Brooklyn in search of the Dhampir daughter of a vampire from his native Caribbean island in order to live beyond the night of the next full moon. This Dhampir turns out to be NYPD Detective Rita Veder, who is still dealing with the death of her mentally ill mother (a paranormal researcher) some months before. As she and her partner, Detective Justice, are in the middle of investigating the murders on the ship, Rita begins having strange visions about a woman who looks like her, and begins asking questions about her mother's past. When she tells Justice about having \"a strange feeling\" about the investigation, he is skeptical, which frustrates Rita. The visions are presumably influenced in part by her vampire heritage; this is hinted at a few times throughout the first two-thirds of the story. Rita is completely unaware of this heritage, and believes she is losing her mind, similar to what happened to her mother. Meanwhile, Maximillian initiates a series of sinister methods to find out more about Rita and to further pull her into his thrall, including seducing and murdering her roommate Nikki, as well as disguising himself as her preacher and a lowlife crook. Max, in these disguises, misleads Rita into thinking Justice slept with Nikki,...\n****\n[A]: What is the ship inspector's name?\n\n\n[Q]: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In Venice, California, student Daisy (Merissa Mathes) leaves a club alone after having an argument with her beatnik boyfriend Max (Carl Schanzer). Walking through the deserted streets, she stops to admire some gruesome paintings in a gallery window painted by artist Antonio Sordi (Campbell), who coincidentally also comes by to look in on his \"lost children.\" After a friendly conversation, Sordi convinces the young woman to pose nude for him that night. At his bell-tower studio, Sordi is possessed by the spirit of a long-dead ancestor and suddenly transforms into a vampiric monster who hacks the screaming Daisy to death with a cleaver. Afterwards, he lowers her mutilated corpse into a vat of boiling wax. Sordi, in his vampire form, stalks Venice in search of victims; he is able to do so freely at all hours. In the middle of the day, he chases a young woman into the surf at a beach and drowns her. At night, he kills a prostitute in a car while pedestrians stroll by, all of them assuming the pair are lovers sharing an intimate moment. Another victim is approached at a party, chased into a swimming pool, and drowned there after the other guests have moved into the house. The murdered women are carried back to Sordi's studio and painted by the artist, their bodies then covered in wax. Max wants to make up with Daisy but cannot find her anywhere. Learning that she has posed for Sordi and become the subject of the latest in the artist's series of \"Dead Red Nudes,\" he visits her sister Donna (Sandra Knight) to ask her forgiveness. Donna tells Max she hasn't seen Daisy for days, and is concerned about the recent rash of disappearances. She reads Max the legend of Sordi's 15th-century ancestor Erno, a painter condemned to be burned at the stake for capturing his subjects' souls on canvas. Unable to convince Max that Antonio Sordi might also be a vampire, she confronts the artist at his studio and asks him if he has seen Daisy. He angrily brushes her off. That night, he later follows her through the streets and murders...\n****\n[A]: Who does Sordi kill?\n\n\n[Q]: Generate a question about the following movie plot: When Bobby Saint and Mickey Duka meet with European arms dealer Otto Krieg at the Tampa, Florida seaport, the FBI intervenes and Saint is killed while Duka is jailed. \"Krieg\", supposedly killed in the shootout, is actually undercover FBI agent and former U.S. Army Delta Force operator Frank Castle. Shortly thereafter, he retires from the FBI and attends a family reunion at his father's oceanside home in Aguadilla Bay, Puerto Rico. Tampa crime boss Howard Saint is enraged by the death of his son, and with right-hand man Quentin Glass bribes the FBI for confidential information about \"Krieg\". Saint orders Castle murdered, and Saint's wife, Livia, demands Castle's entire family be killed as well to \"settle the score.\" At the reunion, gunmen including Glass and John Saint, kill most of the extended family. Castle and his father kill several of the attackers before Castle's father is killed. Castle's wife and son try to escape, but John Saint runs over them with a truck, killing them. Castle, shot in the chest and blown off a pier in an explosion set by Glass, survives and is nursed back to health by a local fisherman, Candelaria. Once recovered, Castle goes to Tampa and takes refuge in an old tenement where three young outcasts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dave, Bumpo, and Joan \u00e2\u0080\u0094 live. Castle abducts Duka, who fearfully gives up information about the Saints \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whom he, too, hates, and so willingly becomes Castle's mole. Castle starts exacting revenge on the police and FBI agents who have been bribed to close the investigation of his family's murder. In the process, he sabotages Saint's money-laundering business and severs Saint's partnership with Cuban mobsters the Toro Brothers, and starts tailing Livia and Glass, learning in the process that Glass is a closeted homosexual. Saint, realizing Castle is alive, sends two assassins to kill him. Castle kills the first, guitar player Harry Heck, by shooting a ballistic knife into Heck's throat.

He is one of the first American composers of international renown, though his music was largely ignored during his life, and many of his works went unperformed for many years. Over time, he came to be regarded as an \"American original\". He combined the American popular and church-music traditions of his youth with European art music, and was among the first composers to engage in a systematic program of experimental music, with musical techniques including polytonality, polyrhythm, tone clusters, aleatory elements, and quarter tones, foreshadowing many musical innovations of the 20th century. Context_2 : Daniel Evan Freeman (born 27 April 1959) is an American musicologist who specializes in European art music of the eighteenth century, in particular the musical culture of eighteenth-century Prague and the Bohemian lands. He is also active as a pianist and music editor. Context_3 : Art music (also known as Western classical music, cultivated music, serious music, canonic music, and more flippantly, real music or normal music) is an umbrella term that refers to musical traditions, implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition. \"Serious\" or \"cultivated\" music are terms frequently used as a contrast for ordinary, everyday music (popular and folk music, also called \"vernacular music\"). After the 20th century, art music was divided into two extensions: \"serious music\" and \"light music\". Context_4 : In the history of European art music, the term \"common practice period\" refers to the era between the formation and the dissolution of the tonal system. Though there are no exact dates for this phenomenon, most features of the common-practice period persisted from the mid to late baroque period, through the Classical and Romantic periods, or roughly from around 1650 to 1900. While certain prevailing patterns and conventions characterize the music of this period, the time period also saw considerable stylistic evolution. Some conventions evolved during this period that were rarely employed at other times during what may still be labeled \"common practice\" (for example, Sonata Form). Thus, the dates 1650\u20131900 are necessarily nebulous and arbitrary borders that depend on context. The most important unifying feature through this time period concerns a harmonic language to which modern music theorists can apply Roman numeral analysis. Context_5 : The Festival Oude Muziek Utrecht (\"Utrecht Early Music Festival\") is an annual music festival that showcases and celebrates early European art music. The ten-day festival takes place in the Dutch city of Utrecht, and begins in August. The programme comprises concerts, activities, lectures, exhibitions, and a symposium. Context_6 : Assaf Shelleg (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05e1\u05e3 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d2\u200e \u200e ), is a musicologist and pianist, a senior lecturer of musicology at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was previously the Schusterman Visiting Assistant Professor of Musicology and Jewish Studies in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Virginia (2011\u201314), and had taught prior to that as the visiting Efroymson Scholar in the Jewish, Islamic & Near Eastern Languages and Cultures Department at Washington University in St. Louis (2009\u201311). Shelleg specializes in twentieth-century Jewish and Israeli art music and has published in some of the leading journals in both musicology and Israel Studies on topics ranging from the historiography of modern Jewish art music to the theological networks of Israeli art music. Shelleg's book, \"Jewish Contiguities and the Soundtrack of Israeli History\", appeared in November 2014 with Oxford University Press. The book studies the emergence of modern Jewish art music in central and Western Europe (1910s-1930s) and its translocation to Palestine/Israel (1930s-1970s), exposing the legacies of European antisemitism and religious Judaism in the making of Israeli art music. Moving to consider the dislocation of modern Jewish art music the book examines the paradoxes embedded in a Zionist national culture whose rhetoric negated its pasts, only to mask process of hybridizations enchained by older legacies. \"Jewish Contiguities\" has won the 2015 Engle Prize for the study of Hebrew Music, and the 2016 Jordan Schnitzer Book Award. Context_7 : Vocal harmony is a style of vocal music in which a consonant note or notes are simultaneously sung as a main melody in a predominantly homophonic texture. Vocal harmonies are used in many subgenres of European art music, including Classical choral music and opera and in the popular styles from many Western cultures ranging from folk songs and musical theater pieces to rock ballads. In the simplest style of vocal harmony, the main vocal melody is supported by a single backup vocal line, either at a pitch which is above or below the main vocal line, often in thirds or sixths which fit in with the chord progression used in the song. In more complex vocal harmony arrangements, different backup singers may sing two or even three other notes at the same time as each of the main melody notes, mostly with consonant, pleasing-sounding thirds, sixths, and fifths (although dissonant notes may be used as short passing notes). Context_8 : David Wallis Reeves (February 14, 1838 \u2013 March 8, 1900), also known as D. W. Reeves or Wally Reeves, was an American composer, cornetist, and bandleader. He developed the American march style, later made famous by the likes of John Philip Sousa, and his innovations include adding a countermelody to the American march form in 1876. Sousa called Reeves \"The Father of Band Music in America\", and stated he wished he himself had written Reeves' \"Second Regiment Connecticut National Guard March\". Charles Ives also borrowed from the \"Second Connecticut\" on four occasions. Context_9 : \"Indian classical music is one of many forms of art music that have their roots in particular regional cultures. For other \"classical\" and art music traditions, see List of classical and art music traditions.\" Context_10 : Progressive music is music that subverts genre and expands stylistic boundaries outwards. Rooted in the idea of a cultural alternative, musical progressiveness embodies a continuous move between explicit and implicit references to genres and strategies derived from various cultural domains, such as European art music, Celtic folk, West Indian, or African. The word \"progressive\" comes from the basic concept of \"progress\", which refers to development and growth by accumulation, and is often deployed in numerous music genres such as progressive country, progressive folk, progressive jazz, and (most significantly) progressive rock. fact_1 :  Charles Ives also borrowed from the \"Second Connecticut\" on four occasions. fact_2 : Charles Edward Ives ( ; October 20, 1874May 19, 1954) was an American modernist composer. fact_3 :  He combined the American popular and church-music traditions of his youth with European art music, and was among the first composers to engage in a systematic program of experimental music, with musical techniques including polytonality, polyrhythm, tone clusters, aleatory elements, and quarter tones, foreshadowing many musical innovations of the 20th century.

So after the club we go back to our hotel room which is at the MGM. We stop at the front desk to ask if anything was still open at 4 in da monin. They said yes if u walk to our farmers market (which is kinda far and even farther if u been on your feet all day & all nite in some hills) we have a pizza spot & a McDonalds that's 24hours. I so hat3 McD's so we said we would walk back there for the pizza.   So needless to say we get there and both lines are long but McDONT'S is shorter. We both are tired azz h3ll & just want something in our system so we can soak up the liquor & go to bed. So we stand in line for I don't know how long for that nasty azz food get up to the freakin counter to hear we outta food all we have is 5 fishes and 2 chicken. EXCUSE ME !!   1st off ... what the h3ll language r u speakin ? I guess 5 fishes is supposed to be fillet of fish & the 2 chicken with no \"s\" is supposed to be some kind of chicken sandwich. So 2nd'ly...I get upset bcuz y u did not announce that to everyone standing in line. Were practically standing there 4 no freakin reason. So my girl orders the darn 2 chicken. 3rd...who in the h3ll is managing this place ? How r u gonna b open 24hrs and DON'T have any food ? Just freakin turn the lights off at 10pm y don't u !!!  So now were on the long walk back to the room. We get there kick our shoes off get comfy open up our 2 chicken and WOW... bread...mayo...chicken. WHERE THE H3LL IS MY LETTUCE ? WHERE IS MY TOMATOES ? So now I am forced to eat this dry azz sandwich no fries to go with it ( thats the only thing i eat at McDont's is there addictive french fries) and some left over water from the club cuz oh yes...these fools didnt have any beverages either.  Can some 1 help me understand how a fast food chain that claim they sold over a billion hamburgers and so forth run out of food...IN VEGAS...@ THE MGM GRAND who has bookoo money.  So the next nite U know we had to do it all over again but this time we went straight to the pizza spot. I told the pizza man what happened the night b4 and he said  \"IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THAT, THEY SHUT DOWN IF THEY RUN OUT OF KETCHUP PACKAGES\"  In an event of a late night... DO NOT GO 2 MCDONT'S !!!!! U will b HIGHLY upset !  0.0 stars...They deserve 100 rocks thrown @ em\n\n\nQ: negative\n\nA: I came here with a friend when he recommended it. The place was pretty deserted and small but it was to be expected from a random \"fast\" food joint downtown.  I ordered a chicken burger with fries and I'd like to say that charging 1$ for a fucking slice of cheddar is NOT OK.  The food was above average (meat was fresh and cooked well and the fries tasted pretty good) but it was not worth the price. They gave me like 10-12 small curly french fries for 3$. I'm pretty sure I paid 4$ for the presentation. Which is pretty useless if you consider the appearance of the establishment.  What really pissed me off was the wait. 25 fucking minutes for 2 burgers and 2 small portions of fries? Really?   All-in-all, you could walk to M Burg down a few streets, pay a little more and get the best burger in town. Not worth it, there are better places.  Also love how they expect a tip before we're served even though there is barely any service.\n\n\nProblem: What would be an example of an negative (OPTIONS:\n- negative\n- positive) review?\n\nAnswer: terrible rip off.  las vegas joke.  wanted to spend money, got shook down for nothing\n\n\nInput: OPTIONS:\n- negative\n- positive.\nGenerate a positive review for a place\nOutput: I swear every time I go to Raising Cane's I think the workers hate me, because I always put in complicated orders that don't need to be complicated.

The timeframe in which this company sends out things they charge you for the minute you order it but you wont get it for a longer period and that is after they finally mail it. If I could have given it no stars I would have, customer service truly is pathetic with this company or maybe the fact I only bought a lower priced item so they figure my order can sit around and gather dust, even though the product I order they had plenty and were instock of it. Is the review positive or negative?\nNegative\nQ: Title: Good but not great Review: I enjoyed this book but not as much as Ms. Lowell's other Donovan family books. The story moved along briskly and the romance between the feature characters was as expected. However, I was bothered by the apparent indifference of the hero to the innocent victims who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. As in the other books in this series there was a great deal of detail about the lore of rubies. I find this detail a definite plus. Accurate details in the background of a story makes the difference between an adequate story and a good or great one. Is the review positive or negative?\nA: Positive\nQuestion: Title: POOR Quality Review: These bulbs are distributed quite frequently through Lowe's but also many other places. They are only lasting me about 3 months on average. At a price of 6 to 8 dollars each (plus shipping if ordered); that makes them worthless to a retired, disabled veteran. I would think they would be worthless to any one else who bought them and have to climb up and replace them so often.

It heats up the hot chocolate quickly, though if you like your hot chocolate incredibly hot, you may have to run it longer - but it was definitely hot enough for me! I love how easy it is to use.However, there are a few down-sides to the product: the pitcher doesn't detach from the base, so sometimes cleaning it was harder, and you have to unplug the whole thing if you want to take the pitcher to pour drinks somewhere else. Also, the stirring part of the mixer is held in by magnets and after several times of removing it for cleaning, some of the metal balls around the stirrer started falling out (though I didn't notice a change in performance - I'm not sure what the use of those little balls were...)Overall, this is a great and easy product if you want to find something for those who don't like coffee.

Answer of the question can be found directly from the passage.\nSee one example below:\nProblem: Passage: Omelettes make a great breakfast , and I enjoy making them because they are very easy to cook . First , I get the eggs out and begin cracking them on the side of the bowl and dumping them into the bowl . I normally use two eggs whites and one whole egg to cut the calories . I add some salt and pepper to the mix for flavor . I pour the mixture into the hot frying pan . I make sure that I add some vegetable oil to the pan before I add the eggs though because I do n't want them to stick . As this occurs , I add some cheese or vegetable to the center of the egg mixture . Really , almost any type of cheese or vegetable makes a good omelette . I then flip one side of the omelette over on to itself to seal in the contents in the middle . It is then ready to serve ! Question: How many times is the omelette flipped? Option1: three times Option2: once\nSolution: once\nExplanation: As mentioned in the passage that I then flip one side of the omelette; it is clear that omelette is flipped one time only.\n\nProblem: Passage: One morning while drinking my coffee , I glance at the calendar and realize that my brother 's birthday is next week . I have n't gotten him anything yet , and decide I should probably do that today before I forget . I spend some time thinking about what I think he might like to receive as a gift for his birthday . He really enjoys reading science fiction novels , so I decide I 'll go to the Barnes and Nobles and see if I can find a book that he will enjoy . I really love going to the book store so I spend some time browsing the books to see if I can find anything I think might be interesting . There are so many different science fiction novels to chose from . I finally find a novel about space exploration and some people who are searching for a new planet to live on . I pay for the book and take it home and wrap it . Question: When did they go to the book store? Option1: after they drank coffee Option2: One morning while drinking coffee.\nSolution:"}], "response": "after they drank coffee"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Moist winds from the southwest drop an average of 80 inches (2,000 mm) of precipitation on the western side of the mountains, while the northeast-facing slopes average less than half that amount.\n\nAnswer this question based on the passage: when does it snow in north carolina mountains?\nStep-by-step reasoning process: The relevant information is: Mountains usually see some snow in the fall and winter.\n"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM  Question 1.

Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B\nSolution: Yes\nExplanation: It is clearly mentioned in the article that to the check effect of mood on children is the main purpose of the experiment. Hence, B is the correct answer and output is Yes.\n\nProblem: Article: When elephants retire, many head for the Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, Tenn. They arrive one by one, but they tend to live out their lives two-by-two. \"Every elephant that comes here searches out someone that she then spends most all of her time with,\" says sanctuary co-founder Carol Buckley. It's likely having a best girlfriend, Buckley says - \"Somebody they can relate to, they have something in common with.\" Debbie has Ronnie. Misty can't live without Dulary. _ But perhaps the closest friends of all are Tarra and Bella. Tarra, an 8,700 pound Asian elephant; Bella, a stray dog, are closest friends. Bella is one of more than a dozen stray dogs that have found a home at the sanctuary. Most want nothing to do with the elephants and vice versa. But not this odd couple. \"Bella knows she's not an elephant. Tarra knows she's not a dog,\" Buckley adds. \"But that's not a problem for them.\" \"When it's time to eat they both eat together. They drink together. They sleep together. They play together,\" Buckley says. Tarra and Bella have been close for years -- but no one really knew how close they were until recently. A few months ago Bella suffered a spinal cord injury. She couldn't move her legs, couldn't even wag her tail. For three weeks the dog lay motionless up in the sanctuary office. And for three weeks the elephant held vigil: 2,700 acres to roam free, and Tarra just stood in the corner, beside a gate, right outside that sanctuary office. \"She just stood outside the balcony - just stood there and waited,\" says Buckley. \"She was concerned about her friend.\" Then one day, sanctuary co-founder Scott Blais carried Bella onto the balcony so she and Tarra could at least see each other. \"Bella's tail started wagging. And we had no choice but to bring Bella down to see Tarra,\" Blais says. They visited like that every day until Bella could walk. Today, their love -- and trust -- is stronger than ever. Bella even lets Tarra pet her tummy - with the bottom of her enormous foot. They harbor no fears, no secrets, no prejudices. Just two living creatures who somehow managed to look past their immense differences. Take a good look at this couple, human beings. Take a good look at the world. If they can do it -- what's our excuse? \n Question: Which would be the best title for the passage? \n Options: (A) Unlikely friends. (B) Lasting friendship. (C) Unselfish love.

Colman has genetic markers for cystic fibrosis, and kids with the inherited lung disease can\u2019t be near each other because they\u2019re vulnerable to contagious infections. Two siblings with cystic fibrosis also attended Colman\u2019s middle school in Palo Alto, California in 2012. So Colman was out, even though he didn\u2019t actually have the disease, according to a lawsuit that his parents filed against the school district. The allegation? Genetic discrimination. \n  \n Yes, genetic discrimination. Get used to those two words together, because they\u2019re likely to become a lot more common. With DNA tests now cheap and readily available, the number of people getting tests has gone way up\u2014along with the potential for discrimination based on the results. When Colman\u2019s school tried to transfer him based on his genetic status, the lawsuit alleges, the district violated the Americans With Disabilities Act and Colman\u2019s First Amendment right to privacy. \u201cThis is the test case,\u201d says the Chadam\u2019s lawyer, Stephen Jaffe. \n  \n When Colman was born in 2000, DNA analysis of newborns was still rare. But he had a congenital heart problem that led to extra tests. That, in turn, led doctors to discover that he carried some genetic markers associated with cystic fibrosis. His markers are no guarantee of a disease though, and Colman never developed any cystic fibrosis. Still, his parents disclosed the information when filling out a medical form to enroll Colman in school. \n  \n That information made its way to teachers, who allegedly told the parents of the two other students with cystic fibrosis during a parent-teacher conference. Those parents allegedly demanded the Chadams remove their son from school. Eventually the the school district allowed Colman to return after missing a couple weeks. \n  \n The Chadams have since moved away from Palo Alto\u2014but the wheels of the legal system are still turning. When the family first sued the school district in 2013, a district court dismissed the case. The Chadams appeal the dismissal to the federal Ninth Circuit court in January. The Departments of Justice and Education have also written a brief in support of the Chadam\u2019s case, which suggests the federal government has taken an interest in the case and its outcome. \n  \n A Railroad Company and Carpal Tunnel \n  \n To experts in genetics law, four letters are conspicuously missing from the legal wrangling: GINA, or the federal Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008. GINA bars genetic discrimination in just two cases: employment or health insurance. That obviously doesn\u2019t include getting education and housing and plenty of other situation where discrimination might happen. \u201cThis case is an useful reminder about the limitations of the federal statute,\u201d says Jennifer Wagner, a lawyer and contributing editor to Genomics Law Report. That\u2019s why the Chadam\u2019s case does not rest on GINA but the ADA, where its application to genetic discrimination is untested. \n  \n There is, however, a one example of how the ADA and genetic information intersect. Back in 2001\u2014before GINA passed\u2014the railroad company Burlington Northern Santa Fe was looking for genetic markers for carpal tunnel syndrome in its workers who filed for worker\u2019s comp. (The workers claimed their carpal tunnel syndrome came from operating BNSF machinery; the company was clearly looking for another excuse.) \n  \n The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed suit on behalf of the workers, and they eventually reached a settlement in 2002. The workers got $2.2 million\u2014but because the suit ended in a settlement rather than a court decision, it did not establish a legal precedent for the ADA covering discrimination based on genes. The outcome in Chadam\u2019s case could, if a trial goes forward, spell out exactly who gets to access genetic information and what decisions can be made based on it. \n  \n In the fifteen years since Colman got a DNA test as a baby, tests have only gotten cheaper and more popular. You have 23andMe\u2019s $199 spit test, of course, but also the National Institutes of Health pumping $25 million into baby sequencing studies. \u201cAs we do more screening earlier and earlier in life, there\u2019s potential for misuse of information in ways that are harmful, that could potentially discourage parents from seeking genetic testing even if it\u2019s medically indicated,\u201d says Michelle Lewis, a pediatrician, attorney, and research scholar at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics.

Inside their legal battle against the school district in Palo Alto, California. \n  \n On Oct. 10, 2012, 11-year-old Colman Chadam was pulled out of class at his public middle school in Palo Alto, California, and asked if he wanted to say goodbye to his friends. According to Chadam\u2019s parents, the teacher told him it was his last day at the school. Officials allegedly told the Chadams that the reason for their son's dismissal involved his DNA: Colman had genetic markers associated with the rare disease cystic fibrosis \u2014 even though, James and Jennifer Chadam say, he is healthy and has never had the actual disease. The Chadams say that a teacher revealed this confidential information to other parents, who then complained that Colman posed a health risk to their children, inciting the Palo Alto Unified School District to force Colman to transfer schools, according to their complaint. So they sued, alleging that the district violated the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and their son\u2019s First Amendment rights to the privacy of his medical information. Their 2013 lawsuit, which sought to recoup legal fees and damages, was thrown out by a federal court that said there wasn\u2019t enough evidence that the district denied Colman access to a service because it considered him disabled. But this month, the Chadams appealed to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 and attorneys for the U.S. Departments of Justice and Education are voicing support for the family. As DNA testing proliferates, this case raises broader issues about how genetic information should be protected and shared \u2014 not just in schools but also in workplaces and insurance companies. \u201cThe family would like a definitive and unequivocal statement from the Ninth Circuit that you can\u2019t just do this to people based on genetic markers alone,\u201d Stephen Jaffe, the family\u2019s attorney, told BuzzFeed News in an interview. \u201cThe more people that get genetic testing done, either for medical reasons or recreationally, the more possibility this stuff gets out. \u2026 It\u2019s not a great leap to be concerned about what happens to this information.\u201d A spokesperson for the Palo Alto Unified School District said in an email, \"The Palo Alto Unified School District cares about and is committed to the safety and well-being of its student population. That said, the case is on appeal because the Federal District Court found the claims insufficient to allege fault on the part of the District. PAUSD continues to agree with the ruling of the Federal District Court.\" \n  \n Colman\u2019s DNA was analyzed as part of a treatment he underwent after having emergency surgery to correct a heart defect at birth in 2000. From a DNA test, Colman\u2019s parents learned he had genetic markers linked with cystic fibrosis \u2014 an inherited disease that creates thick, sticky mucus in the lungs and digestive system. Yet Colman has been monitored ever since and has never developed the illness, his parents alleged in court documents filed Jan. 14. \n  \n Based on the complaint, Colman\u2019s genes appear to contain a mutation or mutations that have been identified in people with \u2014 but are not necessarily proven to lead to \u2014 cystic fibrosis, Dr. Dennis Nielson, director of UC San Francisco\u2019s Cystic Fibrosis Center, told BuzzFeed News. Out of 2,000 associated mutations, \u201cthere are 160 or more we know cause disease,\u201d said Nielson, who does not have direct knowledge of the case. \u201cThere will be a bunch more that cause disease that we don\u2019t know that much about. There are a whole bunch of genetic variations that cause minor problems that don\u2019t ever lead to the kinds of problems we really define as cystic fibrosis.\u201d Colman\u2019s genetic makeup wasn\u2019t an issue until summer 2012, the Chadams say, when they moved to Palo Alto. To enroll Colman at Jordan Middle School, Jennifer Chadam filled out district-requested paperwork with private medical information about him, according to the lawsuit. That September, one of Colman\u2019s teachers told another set of parents that Colman \u201chad the disease of cystic fibrosis,\u201d according to the complaint. \n  \n These parents, whom the lawsuit refers to as \u201cMr. and Mrs. X,\u201d appeared to be alarmed by the news because their children had active cystic fibrosis. People with cystic fibrosis can cross-infect each other and spread germs that lead to lung infections, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. (The organization recommends that such people keep at least 6 feet apart and use separate facilities.) School administrators told the Chadams that these other parents had \u201cdiscovered\u201d Colman\u2019s condition, according to the lawsuit. Mr. and Mrs. X then allegedly asked the district to remove Colman from school, citing concerns about their children\u2019s health \u2014 even though the Chadams explained that Colman was healthy. The Chadams\u2019 doctor also defended Colman in a letter, saying that he wasn\u2019t a health risk, according to the lawsuit. To diagnose cystic fibrosis, doctors look for not only genetic mutations, but also a positive sweat test (a high amount of salt in sweat) and a clear symptom like a lung infection. Only then does someone have cystic fibrosis, said Nielson of UCSF. \u201cIf he really doesn\u2019t have clinical cystic fibrosis,\u201d he said of Colman, \u201cthen he\u2019s not a risk to anybody else.\u201d \n  \n In 2012, when Colman was told he would be transferred to another school, his family sought injunctive relief and settled that case, which ultimately kept him in school. The Chadams later sued in federal court; the district successfully sought to dismiss the lawsuit. The trial court ruled in 2014 that the district had reasonably believed, based on medical advice it had received, that Colman did pose a health risk, and therefore hadn\u2019t violated the ADA. The Chadams didn\u2019t show evidence that the district had denied Colman access to a service, program, or activity because it considered him disabled, the trial court ruled. It also ruled that under the First Amendment, the Chadams could sue only individual employees in the school district, not the school district as a whole. The district cited a letter from a Stanford University doctor recommending that the school remove Colman for the safety of Mr. and Mrs. X\u2019s children, according to court documents. But the Chadams say in court filings they did not know who the doctor was, despite asking the district. \n  \n Jaffe, the Chadams\u2019 attorney, argued in the appeal that the trial court order suggests that \u201ca school district\u2019s real or imagined concern over potential safety issues overrides ... an individual\u2019s First Amendment rights to the privacy of his medical and other information. That is a dangerous holding against which a strong public policy exists.\u201d He cited a 1987 case in which the Supreme Court ruled against discrimination based on the contagious effects of a physical impairment. \n  \n And he argued that the Chadams' case could have broad implications. \u201cAffirming the district court\u2019s ruling in this case will open a wide gap in the wall of privacy protection the law presently affords personal genetic information,\u201d Jaffe continued. \u201cIt will implicitly permit unqualified non-medical persons such as school districts, insurance companies and employers to base life-altering decisions on private genetic information. It will cause the public to hesitate or refuse to get genetically screened when to do so may be in their best interests or would assist medical research.\u201d \n  \n He described one hypothetical scenario to BuzzFeed News: \u201cAn employer sees some of his employees has a genetic marker \u2026 and says \u2018I\u2019m going to fire you because you\u2019re a danger to my other employees and I don\u2019t want them getting sick.\u2019 That\u2019s not a great leap.\u201d The Chadams now also have support from attorneys from the Departments of Justice and Education. In an amicus curiae brief filed this week, they argued that the trial court hadn\u2019t had the legal grounds to throw out the case \u2014 so it should be revisited. \u201cIn view of these straightforward allegations,\u201d they wrote, \u201cthe complaint cannot reasonably be construed to allege anything other than that defendant intentionally removed (Colman) from his school, and therefore denied him the benefit of attending his neighborhood school, because of his perceived disability.\u201d \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n Stephanie Lee is a senior technology reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in San Francisco.

In people with CF, thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs also allows germs to thrive and multiply. This buildup makes them more susceptible to developing lung infections. Despite significant progress in treating CF, infections remain a serious problem and can lead to worsening lung disease and death. However, there are steps you can take to lower the risk. \n  \n Lowering the Risk of Cross Infection \n  \n When there is more than one person with CF in your school, it is essential that they be kept a minimum of 6 feet (2 meters) apart from each other. Germs can spread as far as 6 feet through droplets released in the air when people cough or sneeze. \n  \n If there is more than one person with CF in the same school or classroom, the following steps can help minimize the spread of germs between people with CF. These recommendations are based on recent research and have been reviewed by medical experts. \n  \n 1. Minimize the time that two people with CF can spend in one place. A minimum 6-foot distance should be maintained at all times. \n  \n Place people with CF in separate classrooms whenever possible. \n  \n If they must be in the same classroom, make sure the individuals are assigned separate desks and or work stations as far away as possible (a minimum of 6 feet) from the assigned location of the other person with CF. \n  \n Assign separate bathrooms and drinking fountains for students and staff members with CF. \n  \n Schedule the students with CF to be in other common gathering areas, such as the gym, at different times. \n  \n Assign lunch tables, lockers, etc. for all students with CF to be as far away as possible from the assigned locations of other students with CF. \n  \n Assign different locations for people with CF to go for their medications, or have the school nurse visit each student in their separate classrooms to administer the medications. \n  \n If a person with CF becomes ill while in school, one student can go to the health office, another to the principal's office and a third to the counselor's office. \n  \n If a student with CF is ill or needs to go to another room or office to get medications, the staff in that office should be notified prior to sending the student to the office to ensure that another person with CF is not present. \n  \n 2. Encourage everyone to wash or clean their hands \n  \n Germs can spread when people touch something with germs already on it, like a doorknob or desk, and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth. \n  \n Everyone should clean their hands after coughing, sneezing or blowing their nose and after using common equipment (e.g., a pencil sharpener, lab equipment, etc.). This is especially important during the cold and flu season. \n  \n Make alcohol-based hand gel and or soap and water readily available for all students and staff to use in the classrooms. \n  \n 3. Encourage everyone to cover their cough. \n  \n Germs can remain in the air on tiny droplets -- ready to be breathed in. They can also remain on surfaces long after a person has coughed or sneezed on or near them. \n  \n Make tissues readily available and encourage people to cough or sneeze into a tissue and throw it away immediately before washing or cleaning hands. If a tissue is not available, encourage everyone to cough or sneeze into their inner elbow. \n  \n 4. Encourage everyone to get vaccinated. |||||\nWhat is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?\n"}], "response": "\u2013 When Colman Chadam was born in 2000, he underwent extra medical tests after a congenital heart issue was discovered. Doctors learned that the infant carried genetic markers associated with cystic fibrosis, but he never went on to develop the disease. In fact, that test was the boy's only interaction with it\u2014until 2012, when he was kicked out of middle school. His parents had offered up the information when they enrolled him at a school in Palo Alto, Calif., and somehow teachers found out, reports Wired. Those teachers allegedly told parents of two kids with cystic fibrosis during a parent-teacher conference, and suddenly those parents were demanding Colman's removal because their own kids would be more vulnerable to infection. (Per the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, people with CF are known to be able to spread \"certain germs among others with the disease.\") It all played out a bit like the medical version of thought crime\u2014where potential (or in this case predisposition) is punished\u2014but within a few weeks the school let Colman return, thanks to the family obtaining an injunctive relief; now the Chadams have relocated altogether. Still, their lawsuit accusing the district of violating both the Americans With Disabilities Act and privacy rights is still making its way through the courts, as they appealed to the US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals last month and got some support from the DoJ and Department of Education, per this amicus curiae brief. \"The family would like a definitive and unequivocal statement from the Ninth Circuit that you can't just do this to people based on genetic markers alone,\" their attorney tells BuzzFeed. The implications could be broad, not only regarding how genetic information can be used, but who gets to make decisions based on the resulting \"real or imagined\" safety concerns, he adds.

He logically knows it is time to give up his attempts to enter piano competitions and instead accept a salaried position as a music teacher. Paul also needs to help his mother and his seriously ill father, but he decides to travel to San Francisco for an international piano competition. Doing so could cost him his job waiting for him in Chicago; nevertheless, he wants to try his luck for the last time before passing the age limit to compete. The competition for a financial grant and two years of concert engagements pits the intense and arrogant Paul against a select group of talented artists. He advances to the final round of six, which includes a brash New Yorker named Jerry DiSalvo, who only knows how to play one concerto, Michael Humphries, who rehearses in the nude, Canadian pianist, Mark Landau, who is note-perfect but emotionally moribund, and a meek Russian girl, Tatjana Baronova, whose teacher disrupts the competition by defecting to the United States.

Heidi's esteemed music teacher, Greta Vandemann, advises her to avoid letting personal matters interfere with her concentration.

A crew of eight pilot a colossal nuclear bomb aboard the spaceship Icarus II, with the intent to jump start the sun, and return to Earth. As they pass Mercury's orbit, Icarus II discovers the distress beacon of Icarus I, the first ship to attempt their mission, which disappeared seven years earlier. Reasoning that two bombs have a better chance of success than one, physicist Capa recommends Captain Kaneda change course and commandeer Icarus I. Mace, the ship's engineer, opposes the deviation as risky. Navigator Trey calculates a trajectory to intercept Icarus I, but forgets to realign the shields that protect the ship from the sun, causing damage to several shield panels. Kaneda and Capa embark on a spacewalk to make repairs, assisted by Pilot Cassie, who angles the damaged portion of the shield away from the sun. The angle however allows the sun to destroys the ship's oxygen garden and oxygen reserves. As Icarus II's autopilot returns the shield to its original alignment, Kaneda orders Capa to safety and repairs the last panel, moments before he's immolated. Trey blames himself for the loss of Kaneda, and psychiatrist Searle assesses him as a suicide risk, sedating him. Icarus II docks with Icarus I. Capa, Searle, Mace, and now-Captain Harvey search the vessel, leaving Cassie and botanist Corazon on board Icarus II. They discover Icarus I's mainframe has been sabotaged, making its bomb delivery impossible. In the ship's log is a rambling message from Captain Pinbacker, who abandoned his mission. The crew of Icarus I is found charred to death in the solar observation room, where they were long ago exposed to the un-shielded sun. Suddenly, the two ships explosively decouple, destroying Icarus I's outer airlock, stranding the four crew members on it. Mace suggests one crew member stay behind to manually operate the airlock while the other three jettison between airlocks, using the vacuum release for propulsion. Searle volunteers to stay behind.

Movie plot title: National Lampoon's Animal House Movie plot: In 1962, Faber College freshmen Lawrence \"Larry\" Kroger and Kent Dorfman seek to join a fraternity. Finding themselves out of place at the prestigious Omega Theta Pi house's party, they visit the slovenly Delta Tau Chi house next door, where Kent is a \"legacy\" who cannot be rejected due to his brother having been a member. John \"Bluto\" Blutarsky welcomes them, and they meet other Deltas including biker Daniel Simpson \"D-Day\" Day, ladies' man Eric \"Otter\" Stratton, and Otter's best friend Donald \"Boon\" Schoenstein, whose girlfriend Katy is constantly pressuring him to stop drinking with the Deltas and do something with his life. Larry and Kent are invited to pledge and given the fraternity names \"Pinto\" and \"Flounder\" respectively, by Bluto, Delta's sergeant-at-arms. College Dean Vernon Wormer wants to remove the Deltas, who are already on probation, so he invokes his emergency authority and places the fraternity on \"double-secret probation\" due to various campus conduct violations and their abysmal academic standing. He directs the clean-cut, smug Omega president Greg Marmalard to find a way for him to remove the Deltas from campus. Various incidents, including the prank-related accidental death of a horse belonging to Omega member and ROTC cadet commander Douglas Neidermeyer, and an attempt by Otter to date Marmalard's girlfriend further increase the Dean's and the Omegas' animosity toward the Deltas. Bluto and D-Day steal the answers to an upcoming test from the trash, not realizing that the Omegas have planted a fake set of answers for them to find. The Deltas fail the exam, and their grade-point averages fall so low that Wormer tells them he needs only one more incident to revoke their charter. To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a toga party and bring in Otis Day and the Knights to provide live music. Wormer's wife attends at Otter's invitation and has sex with him.

When Frank is wounded and dies of his wounds, he is replaced by Dave (Peter Phelps). Dave finds himself unable to fire his weapon in combat and is transferred to the Medical Corps, where he will not need to carry a weapon, but where he will still be exposed to the fighting. The British plan the capture of Beersheba. During an attack by Turkish cavalry, Major Richard Meinertzhagen (Anthony Andrews) deliberately leaves behind documents indicating that the attack on Beersheba will only be a diversion. The Australians leave for Beersheba, with limited water and supplies. They bombard the town and the 4,000 Turkish-German defenders prepare for an assault. However, the German military advisor, Reichert (Shane Briant), believes it is a diversionary attack and advises the Turkish commander he does not need reinforcements. With time running out and water in short supply, the British command suspect any attack upon Beersheba will probably fail. However, the Australian commanders ask the British to send in the Australian Light Horse\u00e2\u0080\u0094the British consent to what they think is a suicide mission.

The Australians begin advancing on the Turkish positions, gradually speeding up to a charge. The Turks realise too late that the soldiers are not dismounting and open fire. Artillery fire is sporadic and of limited effect and the attack so fast the Turkish infantry forget to adjust the sights on their rifles as the Light Horse get closer, eventually firing straight...

The 5-3 Falcons were determined to rebound from their disappointed Week 9 loss to the Detroit Lions. In the first quarter, nothing happened until very late. With 3:33 remaining in the quarter, Browns quarterback Charlie Frye connected on a 40-yard pass to tight end Kellen Winslow. That put the Browns on the Atlanta 6-yard line and 3 plays later, on 4th and 1, the Browns scored on a run by running back Reuben Droughns and the Browns took a 7-0 lead. The second quarter started with a bang for the Browns. Atlanta had 2nd and 9 on the Cleveland 49 when Falcons quarterback Michael Vick threw an interception to Browns safety Sean Jones. The Browns drove the ball quickly down the field and, with 11:59 remaining in the quarter, Charlie Frye connected with tight end Braylon Edwards on a 19-yard touchdown pass. The Browns lead was 14-0. At the two-minute-warning, Reuben Droughns fumbled on the Atlanta 35. The Falcons attempted a two-minute-drill offense, but the Browns stood Vick up at the Browns 26. However, Falcons kicker Morten Andersen kicked a 44-yard field goal to get on the board 14-3 at halftime Very little happened in the third quarter. Michael Vick was driving in Cleveland territory with 5:28 remaining when he was intercepted again by Browns safety Brodney Pool. However, the ensuing Browns possession resulted in a Dave Zastudil punt. The punt was out of their own endzone and was returned to the Browns 12. It took two plays for Vick to connect with wide receiver Michael Jenkins for a touchdown. The score was then 14-10. The possibility of success seemed unlikely for the Browns in the fourth quarter. After the teams each went three and out, Atlanta gained favorable field position and were able to bring Andersen in for a 46-yard field goal.  At that point the Browns were leading 14-13. The next drive for the Browns looked promising. After two passes to tight end Steve Heiden and a 36-yard pass to Kellen Winslow, the Browns then faltered and had to settle for a 43-yard Phil Dawson field goal. The score was 17-13. With 3:18 remaining in the game, Atlanta took over on their own 28-yard line. Down by 4, Vick let in loose downfield to an open receiver Roddy White for a 55-yard gain. The Falcons then committed a 10-yard penalty and Vick threw an incomplete pass. With 2nd and 20 on the Cleveland 27, Vick fumbled the ball on 3rd down to a waiting Browns rookie cornerback Jereme Perry. Out of timeouts, the Falcons fell for a second week in a row to the Browns. \nQuestion: How many points were scored from field goals? \nAnswer type: Number \nSolution:"}], "response": "9."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Teacher:In this task, you need to count the number of times the given letter appears in the given sentence.\nTeacher: Now, understand the problem?

Article: NANJING -- Another human H7N9 case has been found in east China's Jiangsu Province, the provincial health department confirmed on January 31. The patient, a 75-year-old woman from the provincial capital of Nanjing, is in a critical condition. The case brings the number of infections in the province to eight this year. H7N9 has killed 19 in China this year, and the total number of human infections reached 96 on January 26, according to the   Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. With bird flu cases increasing on a daily basis, public concern over people-to-people transmission during Spring Festival is growing. Li Lanjuan, researcher at the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a specialist in H7N9 prevention, said so far there have not been any cases in which one person transmits the flu to another, and the latter transmits the virus to a third person. Her team has identified H7N9 virus mutations this year, but the  _ are not large-scale. \"Inter-human transmission is very unlikely,\" said Li, who added that the virus has not evolved to be extensively drug resistant. The National Health and Family Planning Commission said on Wednesday live poultry markets should close if any case of H7N9 avian flu is detected. The southern metropolis of Shenzhen has closed all live poultry   markets until February 13 for a thorough cleaning. The city near Hong Kong has reported 14 human H7N9 cases since December 18. Live poultry trading has been halted in Hangzhou, Ningbo and Jinhua cities in Zhejiang, which reported the largest number of human H7N9 cases. China has stepped up   research for an H7N9 vaccine in the face of the increasing threat from the virus. Beijing's Snovac Hotech Ltd.,which developed the A/H1N1 and H5N1 vaccines, said in a press release on Wednesday that it has completed preclinical   studies of an H7N9 vaccine arid prepared several types for clinical testing. The company has submitted an application to the China Food and Drug Administration to start clinical trials. Question: What can we learn from the news report?

Article: The meal you eat after exercising matters! No matter what time of day you exercise, the key is to follow the exercise up with meals that supply enough nutrition  . For the best results, eat within 30 to 60 minutes after exercising, when the muscles are at the best time to take in nutrients. Here are some ideas for meals after exercising. Home-made sports-recovery drink Mix banana, milk, and yogurt to make a fresh and satisfying sports-recovery drink. Dairy products like milk and yogurt work double duty, providing both protein   and carbohydrates  . A cup of coffee, on the other hand, is a poor choice. Protein-packed sandwich You can't go wrong with a sandwich after exercising --it's got everything in a hand-held package. Sandwiches provide the salt you need to replace what you lost by sweating  , while the tomatoes in them supply plenty of Vitamin C. Try using whole-wheat bread to give yourself more fiber. The cheese and fresh vegetables in sandwiches are also great for helping tired muscles recover. Power breakfast An egg sandwich is a perfect post-exercise breakfast. There's protein in both the yolk and the white of the egg. This recipe increases your protein intake   while keeping calories and fat under control. Eggs also contain zinc  , which helps protect against disease. Plant-based protein Beans are an amazing source of plant-based protein and carbohydrates. Make a large bowl of bean salad in the beginning of a week, and you'll have a great post-exercise meal that's ready whenever you need it. Question: Which of the following helps increase protein intake and keep calories and fat under control?

During hurricane Georges, I slept. But there was a lot of lightning, thunder and rain at that night. The next morning, there were a lot of branches, twigs and leaves everywhere. Catherine's Hurricane Experience This year, we experienced two hurricanes, Earl and Georges. We did the same thing in both hurricanes. We would always be watching the news. There was a lot of rain ... a whole lot of rain. The hurricane never really got close enough to do very much damage. I have never evacuated, and I don't think that I ever will. Ryan's Hurricane Experience I am a police officer on an island in the Texas Gulf Coast. I was directly affected by the violent weather throughout the hurricane season. Our department was ordered to stay on the island while all the other citizens were evacuating. I didn't feel at all prepared for the situation. So I went to the grocery store and purchased some food. I thought a survival kit would have helped ease some of the tension in my mind. Question: Which of the following is NOT true about the hurricanes? Answer:\nOPTIONS:\n- Hurricane Opal hit in 1995.\n- Hurricane Georges hit at night.\n- Hurricane Opal hit on John's way to the school.\n- Hurricane Georges blew down many branches.\noutput:"}], "response": "Hurricane Opal hit on John's way to the school."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Problem: \nQ: Title: Would do it again.

I have no idea what the problem is, except that maybe my computer is actually too NEW. It really sucks because I was looking foward to playing the sonic games, since im a big sonic fan.

A year after the song was published Dresser's brother Theodore, who later became a famous novelist, privately claimed to have authored its lyrics. In 1917, after Dresser's 1906 death, Theodore made his controversial claim public in a newspaper article. Already a controversial figure because of his open support for communism and tendency to make negative comments about his home state, Theodore's claims were ridiculed in many papers and by prominent Hoosiers who dismissed it as a hoax. Although Theodore never retracted his assertion that he wrote the first verse and chorus of the song, he downplayed the importance of his alleged contribution in later years. It is possible that Theodore did give his brother the idea for the song, and may have even authored a portion of the lyrics, some of which reflect his writing style. The line stating \"where I first received my lessons, nature's school\" is a possible link, reflecting Theodore's obsession with nature during his youth and his belief that it held the answers to life, a topic he wrote of on several occasions.Dresser died penniless after his publishing business failed. Known for his generosity, he also had a tendency to overspend and give money to his friends and family. In addition, copyrights to Dresser's music were poorly managed after the Haviland and Dresser Company went bankrupt in 1905. Maurice Richmond Music, who purchased the bankrupt company's copyrights, gave Ballard MacDonald and James Hanley permission to use two bars from Dresser's ballad in a song they published in 1917. MacDonald and Hanley's \"Back Home Again in Indiana\" has since eclipsed \"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\" in public use. Their song borrowed heavily from \"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\" in the chorus, both musically and lyrically, using far more than just the two bars granted to them. Twenty-six bars from the last two lines of the chorus are copied almost identically.

That was our destiny. That was our share in life,\u201d the scientist said. Battling stomach cancer, the loss of a home, career and seven family members, the man, whose name remains confidential to protect his identity as a refugee, expressed his hope for a new life in the United States. \n  \n \u201cI learned today that I\u2019m going to Troy, Michigan,\u201d he said. \u201cI know nothing about it.

On Saturday afternoon, actor Edward Norton also began a fundraiser for the scientist, raising even more for the refugee who says he \u201cjust wants to be a person again.\u201d \n  \n \u201cThe response has been overwhelmingly positive,\u201d said Kang. \u201cA lot of people thanked me for doing a nice thing but I really feel like I was doing what anyone else would have done.\u201d \n  \n Kang said he\u2019s received many messages from people expressing their gratitude, those who want to reach out to the man personally, as well local companies interested in working with the scientist. This includes invitations to lecture at local colleges, research job opportunities and potential help from local medical facilities in treating the man\u2019s stomach cancer. \n  \n \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot of interest in helping him out,\u201d he said. \n  \n The biggest concern, said Kang, are those skeptical of how the money will reach the man. \n  \n Kang, who has successfully crowdfunded in the past, is working closely with GoFundMe, the local refugee relocation agency Lutheran Social Services of Michigan, and is in communication with the Humans of New York staff to make sure all funding goes to the scientist. \n  \n In the end, Kang said he just hopes the scientist receives the welcome he deserves. \n  \n \u201cIf I could talk to him right now, I\u2019d just tell him how sorry I am for everything he\u2019s been through and that he\u2019s coming to a great place.

Posted by Humans of New York on Tuesday, December 8, 2015 ||||| ISTANBUL \u2014 The grieving refugee who touched hearts as \"The Scientist\" on the Humans of New York blog only mustered a brief smile when told that a Hollywood star had helped raise $450,000 for him. \n  \n Hours before flying to Michigan to start a new life in the U.S. on Thursday, the cancer-stricken Syrian civil engineer glanced down. \n  \n \"I didn't hear about it, but I want to thank him very much from the humanity perspective,\" he said after NBC News revealed the crowdfunding appeal. Oscar-nominated actor Edward Norton was moved to tears after reading the refugee's biography on the photography site last week and launched the fundraiser. \n  \n \"There are people outside who need that money much more than me,\" The Scientist said, displaying the sort of compassion and humility that helped his story go viral. \n  \n The Scientist, who asked NBC News to refer to him as \"Abu Ammar\" to protect family in Syria, said his life was shattered by a bomb that killed his wife and daughter just under three years ago. \n  \n He was later diagnosed with stomach cancer, and has had to care for five remaining children. \n  \n They include a teenage son, who is still reeling after watching his mother die, and a daughter who carries inside of her shrapnel from the attack on April 6, 2013. \n  \n \"When a bomb drops you don't know where it comes from,\" he said. \"There is no question our lives changed after that ... 180 degrees. I am mentally tired, in overwhelming sadness.\" \n  \n \u201c As long as there are good people in the world \u2026 then we can stop this bloodshed\u201d \n  \n On Thursday, Abu Ammar and four of his children flew to Troy, Michigan, as part of a United Nations refugee resettlement program. \n  \n For about two years, the family had been living close to destitution in Turkey. But the drive to succeed still lingers, Abu Ammar said. \n  \n \"I've had ambitions since I was a child, and right now I'm still that same child with the same ambitions,\" he said. \"But I still have a message \u2014 sometimes when I'm talking to myself I say, 'No, I'm not supposed to die. I need to live long enough to realize my message to humanity.'\" \n  \n Abu Ammar's story on Humans of New York, a popular blog started in 2010 that spawned a bestselling book, prompted an outpouring of compassion. Even President Barack Obama contributed, calling Abu Ammar and his family an \"inspirations\" on HONY's Facebook page. \n  \n \"Yes, you can still make a difference in the world, and we're proud that you'll pursue your dreams here.\" Obama wrote. \"Welcome to your new home.

Some politicians \u2014 notably GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump \u2014 have called for a ban on Muslims entering the country. \n  \n Abu Ammar told NBC News he didn't know anything about the debate over Muslims and immigration raging in the U.S. He also didn't have a solution to the war raging in his home country. \n  \n \"I don't like to get into politics because I am a man of science, and I can separate science and politics completely,\" he said. \"But as long as there are good people in the world, and everyone looks into his or her conscience, then we can stop this bloodshed.\" \n  \n Abu Ammar added: \"No one benefits from people dying, and wars overall never benefit anybody \u2014 so let's hope God can help everyone and put out this fire.\" |||||\nExample output: A Syrian refugee whose moving story went viral earlier this month starts his new life in Troy, Michigan, on Thursday, NBC News reports. The refugee\u2014who wants to keep his real name out of the media to protect family members still in Syria\u2014is known as \"The Scientist\" on the blog Humans of New York, where he was first profiled. \"I learned today that I\u2019m going to Troy, Michigan,\" The Scientist told HONY. \"I know nothing about it. I just hope that it\u2019s safe and that it\u2019s a place where they respect science.\" According to MLive, The Scientist left Syria in 2013 after a bomb killed his wife and one of his daughters. Since then, he's been diagnosed with stomach cancer and was barely scraping by in Turkey.

The output correctly summarizes the articles.\nQ: Logan Melgar hadn\u2019t had a drink on June 4. \n  \n The Green Beret sergeant\u2019s dry day became a key to unraveling the narrative spun by the elite Navy commandos whom military investigators now suspect killed him, officials familiar with the case said. \n  \n Melgar, a staff sergeant in the Army\u2019s 3rd Special Forces Group, was specifically selected for an intelligence operation in the West African nation of Mali. He was well respected by the American Embassy staff and the partner forces there, a former U.S. Africa Command official said. But shortly before he died, Melgar told his wife that he had a bad feeling about two of his partners in that effort, both of whom were members of SEAL Team Six. \n  \n Not wanting to say much more, Melgar informed his wife, Michelle, that he\u2019d tell her the full story when he got back home, according to an official speaking on condition of anonymity because the investigation is still ongoing. \n  \n Now those two Navy SEALs are under investigation for killing Melgar\u2014an investigation, first reported by The New York Times, sending shockwaves throughout the special-operations community. Military experts were hard-pressed to think of another case where elite U.S. troops turned on one another. \n  \n This account is based on five members of the special-operations community who were not cleared to speak publicly. Representatives of both U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) and U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) declined comment for this story, as the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) has an active investigation into Melgar\u2019s death. \n  \n NCIS would not comment beyond confirming the investigation is underway. \n  \n Dirty Money, Damning Excuse \n  \n There is a minimal U.S. troop presence in Mali at most\u2014nothing compared to the 800 troops in neighboring Niger, another West African nation that hosts a sizable special operations cadre. But special operations forces aid U.S. diplomats, Malian soldiers and their French partners in gathering intelligence on a confluence of capable local militants trending Islamist. As the elite troops do in so many countries, they operate in the shadows, with comparatively little oversight\u2014and what their actions actually look like on the ground can be much dirtier than the heroic image the Pentagon prefers to portray. \n  \n For example, part of the intelligence gathering operation in Mali involved a fund used to pay informants. \n  \n Melgar, two special operations sources say, discovered the SEALs were pocketing some of the money from the informant fund. The SEALS offered to cut him in, but Melgar declined, these sources said. \n  \n It is unknown what specifically started the June 4 altercation at 5 a.m. but it escalated. Melgar lost consciousness\u2014and, worse, stopped breathing. The SEALs attempted to open an airway in Melgar\u2019s throat, officials said. It is unknown whether Melgar died immediately. The SEALs and another Green Beret, according to former AFRICOM officials, drove to a nearby French clinic seeking help. Melgar was dead when he arrived at the clinic, the official said. Asphyxiation was the cause of death. \n  \n \u201c It was the worst excuse the SEALs could have made up. The autopsy report said no drugs or alcohol were found in Melgar\u2019s system. \u201d \n  \n With Melgar dead, an apparent panic set in. The SEALs told superiors that Melgar was drunk during so-called combatives\u2014that is, hand-to-hand fighting exercises. The Intercept reported that one of the SEALs, Petty Officer Anthony E. DeDolph, was a mixed-martial arts pro. A source told The Daily Beast the SEALs filed at least one operational report about the incident and possibly two. At least one of the reports included an account that Melgar was drunk. \n  \n It was the worst excuse the SEALs could have made up. A former AFRICOM official who saw the autopsy report said no drugs or alcohol were found in Melgar\u2019s system. At least one source believes he did not drink alcohol at all. The SEALs\u2019 story was unraveling. \n  \n Skeptics From the Start \n  \n A second former Africa Command official said Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc, then commander of Special Operations Command-Africa, was skeptical of the initial reports from the outset. He alerted Army Criminal Investigation Command and told commanders in Mali to preserve evidence. \n  \n Melgar\u2019s wife, Michelle, was also suspicious, three sources tell The Daily Beast. She raised concerns about the cause of death and allegations of drinking, according to three people familiar with the investigation, including providing investigators emails sent by her husband about problems he was having with the SEALs. \n  \n The Daily Beast has reliably heard Michelle Melgar does not wish to be contacted by reporters and has respected that wish. \n  \n Just 34 years old when he died, Melgar, a Texan, was an Afghanistan veteran twice over. His hometown paper, the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, reported that Melgar was a 2006 graduate of Texas Tech. He enlisted in 2012 and joined the Army as an 18X\u2014an off-the-street Special Forces recruit. He graduated from the Special Forces Qualification course in 2016. \n  \n \u201cStaff Sgt.

He is missed dearly every single day, but his legacy lives on.\u201d ||||| Two Navy SEALs being investigated in the strangulation death of Army Sgt. Logan Melgar in Mali in June allegedly offered the Green Beret a cut of the military money they pocketed, but he refused, according to a report. \n  \n Melgar confronted the two Navy SEALs after discovering their alleged scheme, where they reportedly took money for themselves from a fund used to pay informants, the Daily Beast reported. \n  \n The two men tried to get Melgar to join the racket, but he declined the offer, the report said. Melgar later ended up dead in what appeared to be a strangulation. \n  \n Whether the SEALs were involved in the death remained unclear as the investigation continued. The commandos were initially described as \"witnesses,\" but authorities later changed that to \"persons of interest.\" Officials said Melgar's cause of death was \"homicide by asphyxiation.\" \n  \n Melgar, 34, was found dead June 4 at the U.S. Embassy housing he shared in Mali with several other special operations personnel working in West Africa on training and counterterrorism missions, the New York Times reported. \n  \n There have been no charges so far in connection with the homicide, but two member of SEAL Team 6 -- the famous counterterror unit that killed Osama Bin Laden in 2011 -- were placed on administrative leave, pending investigation, according to the Times. \n  \n The SEALs reportedly told their military leaders that they found Melgar and tried to save him, according to the Daily Beast. They also said Melgar was intoxicated that night as he was taking hand-to-hand fighting exercises. \n  \n The autopsy, however, showed no signs of drug or alcohol usage, according to the report. |||||\nA:"}], "response": "A jarring story emerged last month about US special operations forces: Two Navy SEALs are under investigation in the death of an Army Green Beret in the African nation of Mali. Details on a potential motive have been scant, but the Daily Beast has talked to five special-ops sources to lay out a narrative. Staff Sgt. Logan Melgar, the 34-year-old victim, discovered that the Navy SEALs were keeping some of the money that was supposed to go to informants, according to the story. When Melgar found the cash, the SEALs reportedly offered him a share of the take, but he turned them down. This eventually led to a confrontation in the early morning hours of June 4, during which Melgar lost consciousness and stopped breathing, per the Daily Beast. The SEALs and another Green Beret drove Melgar to a clinic, but he was dead upon arrival, US Africa Command officials tell the Daily Beast. At that point, the SEALs' official account of what happened began to unravel. They reported that Logan had been drunk that night, but no alcohol was found in his system during an autopsy, and it's believed that Logan didn't drink, period. Perhaps worse, he had written to his wife about the problems he was having with the SEALs, and she has given those emails to investigators. The official cause of death is \"homicide by asphyxiation,\" per Military.com. No charges have been filed against the unidentified members of Navy SEAL Team 6, who remain on administrative leave as the investigation unfolds."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "(2002) Priorit\u00e9 : 1\n\nTranslate to English\n"}], "response": "(2002) Priority: 1"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I will agree that this is good source of overall view of the certain aspects of art history--the western side.

Just by changing an eyelash yarn to a ribbon, and the wool to a cotton blend, the whole shirt would change. I have enough patterns for knitting shirts (and if I don't, there is the web).This book, though, showed me how changing just a bit here or there can make the pattern my own. I'm not stuck with a railroad yarn or a fluffy wool that would scratch me raw. That is something you rarely see in books these days - how to knit the same pattern with different yarns.Yes, I know that you can change your yarn for any pattern, just gauge it.

My friend Simona Quirini and her family run the beautiful Canto del Maggio, a B&B, restaurant and garden, about one hour\u2019s drive from Florence. We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey. It wasn\u2019t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees \u2014 little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack. With the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona\u2019s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources \u2014 Pellegrino Artusi\u2019s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice\u2019s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns. The secret, other than having beautiful, small and fragrant roses to begin with, is in massaging the petals with a bit of the sugar and the lemon juice until almost a pulp to release the essential oils.

I had one GP \u2014 let\u2019s call him Dr Douche. I promise, it\u2019s the kindest way I could describe him. \u201cThe jacket means I know things.\u201d He came up with wilder and wilder theories as to why I was sick, and kept getting sicker. It should be said beforehand that few of these theories were embodied. He was sure it was something in my ladybrains that was preventing proper function of the rest of me. Dr Douche said so much weird, wild, and just-plain-unbelievable crap over the course of my diagnosis that someday I may create a novel that incorporates it all. But this here has to be the blue ribbon winner. I was describing a symptom to him: every time I got up in the morning, when I first stood, my heart would pound, my heart rate would accelerate, and I\u2019d feel dizzy. After a few probing questions \u2014 (only in the morning? \u2014 no, but it\u2019s worst in the morning)\u2026 \u201cMaybe,\u201d he said sensitively, \u201cyou\u2019re afraid.\u201d \u201cOf standing?\u201d I asked, just to be sure. \u201cYou think I\u2019m afraid of\u2026 standing up.\u201d Maybe he meant there was some kind of existential fear, like, we\u2019re all afraid, it\u2019s a big old universe out there, and he wanted some comfort and reassurance. Nope. The man genuinely thought I had such a profound fear of verticality, that I was having a near-panic in response to being upright. POTS, folks. It was POTS.

Twitter, like many other social platforms, typically measures success in terms of numbers of followers, likes and retweets, but this only tells us something about the spreading of messages but not necessarily whether the content of the messages is understood or embraced. One way to ascertain this is through network and language analysis, which, used together, can tell us how effective the communication is. Economists tweet less, mention fewer people and have fewer conversations with strangers than a comparable group of experts in the sciences, and use less accessible language with words that are more complex, with more abbreviations and with a more distant tone. Their tweets are less personal and less inclusive than those used by scientists. This is what appeared in April 2017 when we gathered data on tens of thousands of tweets from the Twitter accounts of both the top 25 economists and 25 scientists as identified by IDEAS and Science, including the top three economists at the time, Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, and Erik Brynjolfsson and, on the other side, the top three scientists, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Brian Cox, and Richard Dawkins. At that time those accounts covered roughly two thirds of all the following. The timing is significant because 2016 has been declared the year of post-truth politics, the year in which appeals to emotions (pathos) superseded the significance of factual evidence-based information (logos), affecting people\u2019s constructions and interpretations of events. This has been accompanied by the growing prominence of political \u201calt\u201d movements (e.g. UKIP, the Alt-right) and their aggressive, provocative, and populist narratives, and \u201cfake news\u201d leading to political shock events such as Brexit and the Trump election. The relatively low traction of economists in these public debates has been and continues to be an important issue. Does the public not trust economists? Don\u2019t they understand...

His mentor \"Merlin\" (E.J.Andr\u00c3\u00a9) says that he needs to have a better show business gimmick. A year later, Corky comes back as a combination magician and ventriloquist with a foul-mouthed dummy named Fats and is a huge success. His powerful agent Ben Greene is on the verge of signing Corky for his own television show, but Corky bails out for the Catskills, where he grew up, claiming to be \"afraid of success.\" In truth, he does not want to take the TV network's required medical examination because doctors might find out that he suffers from severe issues, and that even off-stage he cannot control Fats (a manifestation of Corky's id). In the Catskills, he reunites with his high-school crush, Peggy Ann Snow, who is stuck in a passionless marriage with Corky's friend from high school, Duke. A magic trick with a deck of cards charms Peg into thinking they are soulmates. She and Corky make love, which sparks the jealousy not only of Peggy's tough-guy husband but also the dummy Fats. Greene arrives unexpectedly, having tracked Corky down. After a tense confrontation, in which Greene discovers the truth about Corky's mental state, the agent demands that Corky get help. Fats, however, convinces Corky to kill Greene. Corky does this by using Fats' hard, wooden head. He then removes all of Greene's identification and drags the corpse to the lake. When Corky tries to dispose of the body, however, Greene suddenly lunges at him, still alive. Corky, after an intense fight, manages to drown him. The next morning, Fats becomes even more possessive and jealous when Corky says that he plans to leave Fats behind so that he and Peggy can honeymoon by themselves. Duke returns from his trip earlier than expected. He suspects his wife cheated on him and wants to have a talk with Corky on the lake. Rather than confront him, Duke awkwardly confides to Corky that he loves Peggy and is worried about losing her. Duke suddenly spots a dead body on the edge...

Plot title: Nuovo Cinema Paradiso Movie plot: In Rome, in the 1980s, famous Italian film director Salvatore Di Vita returns home late one evening, where his girlfriend sleepily tells him that his mother called to say someone named Alfredo has died. Salvatore obviously shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily in 30 years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo is, Salvatore flashes back to his childhood. It is a few years after World War II. Six-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Toto, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the movie house Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start off on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the fatherly projectionist, Alfredo, who takes a shine to the young boy and often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing when there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing a critical romantic kiss or embrace. The local priest had ordered these sections censored, and the deleted scenes are piled on the projection room floor. At first, Alfredo considers Toto a bit of a pest, but eventually he teaches Salvatore to operate the film projector. The montage ends as the movie house catches fire (highly flammable nitrate film was in routine use at the time) as Alfredo was projecting The Firemen of Viggi\u00c3\u00b9 after hours, on the wall of a nearby house. Salvatore saves Alfredo's life, but not before some film reels explode in Alfredo's face, leaving him permanently blind. The Cinema Paradiso is rebuilt by a town citizen, Ciccio, who invests his football lottery winnings. Salvatore, still a child, is hired as the new projectionist, as he is the only person who knows how to run the machines. About a decade later, Salvatore, now in high school, is still operating the projector at the Cinema Paradiso. His relationship with the blind Alfredo has strengthened, and Salvatore often looks to him for help \u00e2\u0080\u0094 advice that Alfredo often...

Plot title: 28 Days Later Movie plot: Late one night, British animal rights activists break into a science laboratory to free chimpanzees being used for medical research. Disregarding the warnings of the local scientist, the activists ultimately free the Rage virus subjects, which attack and infect the activists and scientist.Twenty-eight days later, a bicycle courier named Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakens from a coma in a deserted hospital. As he leaves the hospital, he discovers London is completely deserted and rife with signs of catastrophe. Jim is soon discovered and chased through the streets by infected people before being rescued by two survivors, Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley), who rush him to their hideout in the London Underground. They reveal that while Jim was comatose, the virus spread uncontrollably among the populace, turning most people into vicious monsters (\"the Infected\") and resulting in societal collapse, possibly on a global scale.Selena and Mark accompany Jim to his parents' house, where he discovers that his parents committed suicide. That night, several Infected attack the survivors, and when the fight ends Mark is bleeding. Selena immediately hacks him to death with a machete, explaining to Jim that infection is spread through the blood and overwhelms its victims in seconds, rendering them deadly to others. She warns that should he become infected, she will kill him \"in a heartbeat.\" As the two journey through the derelict city the next day, Selena rules out intimacy between her and Jim, declaring that only the fight for survival remains. They discover two more survivors, Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his teenage daughter Hannah (Megan Burns), holed up in an abandoned apartment tower. Invited to spend the night, Selena and Jim privately debate whether they should remain with Frank and Hannah. Jim says they seem like good people, while Selena fears they will slow her down, warning Jim that putting others ahead of one's own personal survival is a sure way to get killed.The next morning, Frank informs Jim and...

Product review: I really hoped that the PlayStation game would be a great one. After I saw the movie, I decided to buy the game, cuz it sounded neat. Well...the game is a bit disappointing. I expected much more than Harry running around, trying not to be late for class, casting spells, etc. But that's practically ALL that he does. The beginning of the game was interesting, but then you start trying to collect beans, run... errands, blah-blah-blah. Even thought I LOVE platform/adventure games, this didn't work out for me. I got to 60 something % and just quit. It was a bit challenging after the beginning, but then it just got WAY to easy and short, so I dropped this game and choose Ape Escape. Now, Ape Escape is a WAY better game than Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, so if you want a great platform game, choose APE ESCAPE! And the Harry Potter movie was better than the game, so either just watch the movie or rent it, DON'T BUY IT!\nAnswer:"}], "response": "decrease"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Translate to Romanian:\n\nThe Fukushima events have also revealed shortcomings in the international system of safeguards in nuclear power plants.\n\nRomanian:"}], "response": "Evenimentele de la Fukushima au relevat, de asemenea, deficien\u021be ale sistemului interna\u021bional de garan\u021bii de la centralele nucleare."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given an input list.

Jake, not having the disease, is curious to learn more and asks Terry to explain more about it.  Who has blood cells that don't struggle to pass through small blood vessels?  Hint: Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive ( ss ) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin.

Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae.

Hint: The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group.

It worked pretty well, except that I had the router downstairs and it had to transmit through several walls. I added the range extender antennae to the router and could receive anywhere in my 2700 sft home. I replaced the Linksys card with the Belkin and could not log on in hotels or airports while traveling. Furthermore, I have since moved my router upstairs and am sitting 16 feet from it with the range extender antennae and I keep getting dropped signals. My other two computers have no problem picking up reception even though they are 1/2 the home away. I am presently in the market for a new PCMCIA card.

We were constantly and irritatingly molested by Philipinos in suits at every single entrance to the hotel and casino.  Even walking over to the Luxor we were molested to recieve \"free gifts\" that required you to give them $50 to go be at the mercy of some stupid time share demo.  Having to tell someone you aren't interested ten times a day when you use the bathroom next to the doors in the casino is unacceptable.  And they are just doing it to save money on advertising.  MORONIC!!  Now for my review of this horrid hotel:  For staying in one of the \"new remodeled rooms\", I had many baseline expectations that weren't met at all, when I put down these baseline expectations, note that we moved to THE ORLEANS after only one day staying here for 1/3 the price and had the opposite of every single one: 1) The internet was cable only and as a computer geek, even I couldn't get it to work no matter what I did.  No WIFI to speak of. 2)  No coffee maker, something that is standard even in every Motel 6. 3)  The sheets had several rips in them. 4)  No water pressure to speak of in the shower. 5)  Old concaved mattresses. 6)  EVERY line, from signing up for \"MLife\" to checking/out was about 30 minutes long. 7)  Computers when we finally did get up to the head of the checkin/checkout lines, were down BOTH times.  For the price we paid for the room, approx $99, for the one night, we SHOULD'VE had: 1)  Refrigerators in the rooms. 2)  The \"WIDESCREEN REMODELED ROOMS\" in Tower II had no HDTV to speak of, the reception was so bad that the 27\" tubed tv from 1995 in The Orleans put it to shame.  Their technology should be well upgraded by now, it's 2011 and when you \"remodel\" something, it pays to update the hardware. 3)  Where is the WIFI?  This was a MAJOR complaint, for the price of these rooms, you would think it wouldn't take much to put WIFI connections throughout the building and create a sweet network.  I could do it and I'm not even a professional.  All in all, the bad things outweighed the good things, which were really nothing that great that I couldn't get it anywhere else or expect any less.  If you want to be molested by Philipino imports every second and be in a dirty expensive hotel then by all means, go here.  If you want an awesome experience with no lines, great food, wifi, and don't mind being off the strip at $35 a night, then go to The Orleans.  Great GREAT experience here.\n\nInput:  What would be an example of an positive review?\n\nAn example of an positive review: Stopped in to grab a bite after Christmas shopping.

L and L was as good as any other Hawaiian BBQ I've had in the area. I will definitely be back. The only drawback here is that they don't have Crab Rangoon.

The room is large and includes a kitchen, dining roo abke, living room, 1.5 bath, walk-in closet, and huge bedroom. The hotel does have quiet hours, so no late night parties. We loved that part.

Obama answers variety of questions, including what he'll do when out of office. Most of the forum focuses on the economy.\n****\nA: While reaching out to supporters through one of the latest high-tech means, President Obama expanded his social media experience by holding a Google+ video chat room interview Monday afternoon. In an election year, it's probably not good politics to talk about what you look forward to doing after your time in the White House, but that's exactly what President Obama did when asked about the frustrations of living in the security bubble. \"It's the toughest thing about being president. Look, this is the greatest job on Earth, and it's such an honor to serve, but it is true sometimes, you get a little stir crazy,\" he said \"One of the things I look forward to after I've had this extraordinary honor is just taking a walk or waking up on Saturday morning, not shaving and going to the local Starbucks and not having to worry about it.\" The president was also asked to sing and dance, (which he refused) to say hello to one of the questioners' young children, and from an Obama impersonator a question about the impact of comedy sketches on the election. \"I don't know if any of this stuff affects an election, but I know that it makes our country stronger that you can make fun of the president -- or anybody -- and everybody can get a laugh,\" President Obama said. \"And that also makes sure to remind me that I work for you guys.\" Most of the forum, which came in the form of live video connections and video YouTube questions, focused on the economy. \"We're starting to see some signs that the economy is picking up. We've created 3 million jobs over 22 months, and we saw the largest boost in manufacturing jobs that we've seen since the '90s. Best job growth we've seen since 2005. But we've still got a lot more to do,\" President Obama said. \"I have to keep this recovery going, that's why it's so important for us to extend the payroll tax cut.\" The live video chat room included five Americans in cities across the country. Participants were able to follow up with the president after his answers in real time. Jennifer Wedel in Corpus Christi, Texas, asked the president why the government continues to extend visas for immigrant workers when there are many people, like her husband, who have been out of work. President Obama offered to look at her husband's resume to help him find an engineering job. \"Forward me his resume,\" he told her. \"The word we're getting is someone in that high-tech field should be able to find something right away. I want to follow up on that.\" The questions were chosen by Google team members from among the most top-rated of those submitted. Google maintains the White House had no role in the selection of the participants. Obama also held a similar Facebook town hall at the Web giant's headquarters in Palo Alto, California, in the spring, and a YouTube town hall at the White House in February.\n\n\nQ: Jordan Hatch is part of a team dragging government into the 21st century.

Jordan Hatch is the youngest, having walked away from a degree or even A levels to join the Government\u2019s Digital Service aged just 17. Tasked with dragging the civil service into the 21st century, he aims to make government relevant to a generation more used to smartphones than form-filling. Web genius: Jordan Hatch was just 17 when he swapped the classroom for life as a civil servant but he is responsible for some of the most popular features on gov.uk. The team is based in Holborn, halfway between Whitehall and the trendy \u2018Silicon Roundabout\u2019 of internet start-ups in East London. Jordan is the youngest member of a team of 250 which by 2015 is expected to have saved the taxpayer \u00a31.2 billion. Most of the savings come from mothballing scores of websites for ministries and quangos, to create a single site \u2013 www.gov.uk \u2013 which becomes a one-stop site for anyone wanting to find out what the government is doing, or access forms, data or advice. The site has faced criticism for its over-simplified look, but this year beat the Shard and the Olympic cauldron to win Design of the Year. The chance to work on the mega-site, from its early beta stages, proved too much for Jordan. His parents bought their first computer when he was only six and at secondary school he designed websites and taught lessons in IT for other students. He later quit college after completing AS levels in politics, economics and business studies after his freelance computing work took over. He said: \u2018It got to the point where I thought: I've got to make a call. \u2018Do I want to focus on my studies or do I want to leave college and do other things?,\u2019 he told The Times. As a 17-year-old in a government workplace he was too young to officially go to office parties. \u2018It was orange Juice and don't tell anybody I'm here,\u2019 he added. Swapping the classroom for the ultra-informal offices of GDS meant he could quickly put his theory into practice. Now 19, he still lives at home with his parents in North London. But he is responsible for some of the most popular sections of the site, including an updating calendar on when the next bank holiday is and when the clocks change. He has also designed a tool for paying council tax online. Stripped back: The single government website beat the Shard and the Olympics Cauldron to win Design of the Year in April. He could easily get snapped up by internet giants like Apple or Google. But Jordan insists that part of the appeal is making life easier for the Great British public. He said: \u2018It's very nice to work for your country in a sense. The Civil Service is the ultimate British institution and it's great to be a part of that.\" \u2018Working for the public sector is great. You can actually making user's lives easier. That's what keeps me coming back to work.\u2019 Cabinet office minister Francis Maude has already met Jordan, and believes the use of the internet can transform the way the government works \u2013 and spends money. Launching GDS\u2019s new offices, Mr Maude said: \u2018We are determined to offer world class digital products that meet people\u2019s needs and offer better value for taxpayers\u2019 money \u2013 and that is why we have set up the Government Digital Service. \u2018The GDS will be the centre for digital government in the UK. \u2018It will transform the way people access government information by using digital technology to deliver services that put the user first and give them the smartest and most cost-effective service possible.\u2019\n\n\nQ: David Triplow damaged his spinal cord during his first rugby match for his regiment, the Royal Logistics Corp at Deep Cut Barracks in Surrey.

Battled back to health so he could walk with his girlfriend down the aisle. He is now training to take part in the Great North Run next month.\n****\nA:"}], "response": "By. Emma Innes. PUBLISHED:. 11:34 EST, 26 August 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:15 EST, 26 August 2013. A soldier who was told he might never walk again after he broke his neck is set to take part in the Great North Run. David Triplow suffered a devastating injury while playing his first game of rugby for his regiment, but has amazed doctors by battling back to health. The 32-year-old, of Whitburn, South Tyneside, shattered his neck but has since recovered sufficiently to walk his girlfriend, Michelle, 28, down the aisle. David Triplow, 32, broke his neck and damaged his spinal cord while playing his first game of rugby for his regiment. He has amazed doctors by battling back to health and is now training for the Great North Run. Mr Triplow, who was serving with the Royal Logistics Corp at Deep Cut Barracks in Surrey, underwent a nine hour operation after sustaining serious damage to his spinal cord. Surgeons had to pin his spine together and doctors warned he might never walk again. However, he fought his way back to health and has now opened up about the miracle recovery that led him to propose to Michelle. He said: \u2018There was no movement from the waist down, but I woke up one morning several weeks after the accident and things just started to move. \u2018It was like when you wake up in the morning and you yawn and stretch. \u2018I did that and my right leg just lifted off the bed. I started pressing the buzzer and the nurses came running.\u2019 Mr Triplow underwent a nine hour operation during which surgeons pinned his spine back together but he was warned that he might never walk again. For several weeks after the operation, Mr Triplow was paralysed from the waist down but eventually he started to regain movement in his legs. Mr Triplow was transferred from hospital in London to a specialist spinal cord unit at Middlesbrough's James Cook University Hospital. He was also sent to the Headley Court Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre for treatment and had rehabilitation treatment at the Personnel Recovery Centre in Edinburgh. Although with intense physiotherapy he learned to walk again, he was devastated to be medically discharged from the Army in 2011. He has been medically discharged from the army but was well enough to walk his girlfriend, Michelle, down the aisle. He is taking part in the Great North Run, a half marathon, to raise money for the British Legion. Now, five years after being told he would never walk again, Mr Triplow is in training for the Great North Run half marathon in Newcastle next month. He is running to raise funds for the British Legion. Mr Tiplow gave thanks to Michelle, brother Michael, 36, and his parents Jenny, 63, and Bob, 65, for their support. He said: \u2018I am the luckiest man in the world. Without my wife, my family and friends, this would have been a completely different situation.\u2019"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Question:\nSummarize this: the pollution of lampung bay in indonesia as well as the destruction of its marine ecosystem have already reached an alarming level as a result of industrial and household waste disposal and dynamite fishing .\nAnswer:\nwastes damage lampung bay in indonesia\nQuestion:\nSummarize this: the partial agreement reached during the peace negotiations between the macedonian authorities and ethnic albanian rebel forces constitutes `` a positive evolution , '' the french foreign ministry announced thursday .\nAnswer:\nfrance welcomes progress in macedonia peace talks\nQuestion:\nSummarize this: the nets could look at the highlight films and say that they lost thursday night 's game to the los angeles clippers in the final seconds .\nAnswer:\n"}], "response": "a case of overconfidence caused nets to get clipped"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to answer 'Yes' if the given word is the longest word (in terms of number of letters) in the given sentence, else answer 'No'.

Recently , EICAR has furthered its scope to include the research of malicious software ( malware ) other than computer viruses and extended work on other information security topics like content security , Wireless LAN security , RFID and information security awareness .  - A computer virus is a type of malicious software program (\"malware\") that, when executed, replicates by reproducing itself (copying its own source code) or infecting other computer programs by modifying them. Infecting computer programs can include as well, data files, or the \"boot\" sector of the hard drive. When this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be \"infected\" with a computer virus. The term \"virus\" is also commonly, but erroneously, used to refer to other types of malware. \"Malware\" encompasses computer viruses along with many other forms of malicious software, such as computer \"worms\", ransomware, trojan horses, keyloggers, rootkits, spyware, adware, malicious Browser Helper Object (BHOs) and other malicious software. The majority of active malware threats are actually trojan horse programs or computer worms rather than computer viruses. The term computer virus, coined by Fred Cohen in 1985, is a misnomer. Viruses often perform some type of harmful activity on infected host computers, such as acquisition of hard disk space or central processing unit (CPU) time, accessing private information (e.g., credit card numbers), corrupting data, displaying political or humorous messages on the user's screen, spamming their e-mail contacts, logging their keystrokes, or even rendering the computer useless. However, not all viruses carry a destructive \"payload\" or attempt to hide themselvesthe defining characteristic of viruses is that they are self-replicating computer programs which install themselves without user consent.  - Malware, short for malicious software, is any software used to disrupt computer or mobile operations, gather sensitive information, gain access to private computer systems, or display unwanted advertising. Before the term malware was coined by Yisrael Radai in 1990, malicious software was referred to as computer viruses. The first category of malware propagation concerns parasitic software fragments that attach themselves to some existing executable content. The fragment may be machine code that infects some existing application, utility, or system program, or even the code used to boot a computer system. Malware is defined by its malicious intent, acting against the requirements of the computer user, and does not include software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency.

She loves to sit her dolls in the other chairs and plays with her toys. My husband and I are so glad that we purchased her this set because she enjoys it so much! My husband put everything together in under 2 hrs and said that the table was more difficult than the chairs b/c he was alone and could have used a second hand to hold the legs in place. Other that that we have had it for about a month and are loving it so far!

Review: I got my cube in 03 and quickly purchased the 03 version, obviously. Excellent football sim, best I had played to that point. Then got 04, which was basically the same but better. I then got 05 the next year and was very depressed at how much worse it had gotten as far as game play and graphics - more Maddenish which to me is worse - lack of control over the player is the best way I can describe it. Well its now going into the 2008 era and yeah I'm still playing this game, thats how perfect it is. Perfect graphics, perfect control, perfect dynasty mode, way better than 05, they must have changed programmers or something after this one.

Specifically, we examined the effect on vasomotion, a rhythmic dilation and constriction of the arterioles that is involved in fluid and nutrient exchange and modulation of local vascular resistance. In a separate set of experiments, blood flow in the contralateral internal spermatic artery was measured with an ultrasonic flow probe during acute torsion.', \"Following 720 degrees torsion, the amplitude of vasomotion in the contralateral testis increased 121% (29.0 +/- 3.9% versus 13.0 +/- 1.7%) compared with controls. Blood flow in the contralateral internal spermatic artery decreased 43% after 2 hours' torsion.\nAnswer: Acute spermatic cord torsion altered the microcirculation by increasing the amplitude of vasomotion and decreased total blood flow to the opposite testis. Because the hydraulic resistance of a blood vessel exhibiting vasomotion is always less than a vessel with the same average but static diameter, the observed microcirculatory changes may be an adaptive response to preserve local flow in the presence of decreased total flow. The long-term consequences of these changes in the microcirculation may affect testicular function and ultimately fertility.\nA: "}], "response": "Does acute spermatic cord torsion alter the microcirculation of the contralateral testis?"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a sentence not in English.\n"}], "response": "Pour donner un exemple de ce qu\u2019il faut faire en tant qu\u2019Europ\u00e9ens dans le cadre de ce nouveau concept, il me semble que les d\u00e9bats actuels sur le National Missile Defence propos\u00e9 par le Pr\u00e9sident Bush nous placent face \u00e0 des interrogations et \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de nous prononcer."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Le 27\u00a0avril, en s\u00e9ance publique, le Conseil a entendu un expos\u00e9 du Premier Ministre ivoirien, Charles Konan Banny, sur la situation en C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\n\nTranslate this to English?\n"}], "response": "On 27 April, at a public meeting, the Council heard a briefing by the Prime Minister of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Charles Konan Banny, on the situation in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Given a sentence in Spanish, generate a new Spanish sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

He was black and white and had long floppy ears. He also had very short legs, but really big paws. Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles' favorite game. Toodles loved playing fetch. One Saturday, Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. Toodles wasn't having it! He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better. After that, whenever he would see a duck, Toodles would run the other way. \n\"Where did Toodles play fetch?\" is \"At the park\"?\nOutput: yes\nInput: Sound waves are mechanical waves. They can travel only through matter. They cannot travel through empty space. This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules. If they left their space ship and did not use their electronics, they would not be able to hear each other. Next time you watch a science fiction movie, think about this factoid. When spaceships are destroyed by hostile alien beings, there would be no sound heard. Sound waves can travel through many kinds of matter. \n\"Why can't you hear in the vacuum?\" is \"sound is not as loud there\"?\nOutput: no\nInput: His famous series of sixteen great designs for the Apocalypse is dated 1498, as is his engraving of St. Michael Fighting the Dragon. He made the first seven scenes of the Great Passion in the same year, and a little later, a series of eleven on the Holy Family and saints. The Seven Sorrows Polyptych, commissioned by Frederick III of Saxony in 1496, was executed by Durer and his assistants c. Around 1503-1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the Life of the Virgin, which he did not finish for some years. Neither these, nor the Great Passion, were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers. During the same period Durer trained himself in the difficult art of using the burin to make engravings. It is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father, as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith. In 1496 he executed the Prodigal Son, which the Italian Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari singled out for praise some decades later, noting its Germanic quality. He was soon producing some spectacular and original images, notably Nemesis (1502), The Sea Monster (1498), and Saint Eustace (c. 1501), with a highly detailed landscape background and animals. His landscapes of this period, such as Pond in the Woods and Willow Mill, are quite different from his earlier watercolours. There is a much greater emphasis on capturing atmosphere, rather than depicting topography. He made a number of Madonnas, single religious figures, and small scenes with comic peasant figures. Prints are highly portable and these works made Durer famous throughout the main artistic centres of Europe within a very few years. \n\"What skill did Durer possibly learn during his early training with his father?\" is \"Art of painting\"?\nOutput:"}], "response": "no"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 \u00b1 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).\nExample output: 1\nExample explanation: There is a line in the passage which say 'The aim of this study was...' which suggests that it is talking about a specific aim.

Several members of the RASSF family are frequently epigenetically inactivated in cancer, however, their role in leukaemia has remained largely uninvestigated. Also, RASSF10 is a predicted gene yet to be experimentally verified. Here we cloned, characterised and demonstrated expression of RASSF10 in normal human bone marrow. We also determined the methylation status of CpG islands associated with RASSF1-10 in a series of childhood acute lymphocytic leukaemias (ALL) and normal blood and bone marrow samples.', \"COBRA and bisulphite sequencing revealed RASSF6 and RASSF10 were the only RASSF members with a high frequency of leukaemia-specific methylation. RASSF6 was methylated in 94% (48/51) B-ALL and 41% (12/29) T-ALL, whilst RASSF10 was methylated in 16% (8/51) B-ALL and 88% (23/26) T-ALL.

Huntington , and then the second wife of Henry E. Huntington . She was once known as the richest woman in America , and as the force behind the art collection that is housed at the Huntington Library .  - The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens (or The Huntington) is a collections-based educational and research institution established by Henry E. Huntington (18501927) and located in Los Angeles County in San Marino, California, on the western coast of the United States, and about 35 miles northeast of the Pacific Ocean. In addition to the library, the institution houses an extensive art collection with a focus in 18th and 19th-century European art and 17th to mid-20th-century American art. The property also includes approximately 120 acres of specialized botanical landscaped gardens, most notably the \"Japanese Garden\", the \"Desert Garden\", and the \"Chinese Garden\" (Liu Fang Yuan).  - Henry Edwards Huntington (February 27, 1850  May 23, 1927) was an American railroad magnate and collector of art and rare books. Huntington settled in Los Angeles, where he owned the Pacific Electric Railway as well as substantial real estate interests. In addition to being a businessman and art collector, Huntington was a major booster for Los Angeles in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  - Magnate, from the Late Latin \"magnas\", a great man, itself from Latin \"magnus\", 'great', designates a noble or other man in a high social position, by birth, wealth or other qualities. In reference to the Middle Ages, the term is often used to distinguish higher territorial landowners and warlords such as counts, earls, dukes, and territorial-princes from the baronage.  - Los Angeles (Spanish for \"The Angels\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over .    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'occupation' with 'art collector'.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe answer is:\narabella huntington\n\n\nPlease answer this: Information:  - Filmmaking (or in an academic context, film production) is the process of making a film. Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through screenwriting, casting, shooting, sound recording and reproduction, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and exhibition. Filmmaking takes place in many places around the world in a range of economic, social, and political contexts, and using a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques. Typically, it involves a large number of people, and can take from a few months to several years to complete.  - The Selig Polyscope Company is an American motion picture company that was founded in 1896 by William Selig in Chicago. Selig Polyscope is noted for establishing Southern California's first permanent movie studio, in the historic Edendale district of Los Angeles. The company produced hundreds of early, widely distributed commercial moving pictures, including the first films starring Tom Mix, Harold Lloyd, Colleen Moore, and Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle. The business gradually became a struggling zoo attraction in East Los Angeles, having ended film production in 1918.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Keystone Studios was an early movie studio founded in Edendale, California (which is now a part of Echo Park) on July 4, 1912 as the Keystone Pictures Studio by Mack Sennett (1880-1960) with backing from actor-writer Adam Kessel (1866-1946) and Charles O. Baumann (1874-1931), owners of the New York Motion Picture Company (founded 1909). The company filmed in and around Glendale and Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California for several years, and its films were distributed by the Mutual Film Corporation between 1912 and 1915.  - Roscoe Conkling \"Fatty\" Arbuckle (March 24, 1887  June 29, 1933) was an American silent film actor, comedian, director, and screenwriter. Starting at the Selig Polyscope Company he eventually moved to Keystone Studios, where he worked with Mabel Normand and Harold Lloyd. He mentored Charlie Chaplin and discovered Buster Keaton and Bob Hope. Arbuckle was one of the most popular silent stars of the 1910s, and soon became one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood, signing a contract in 1920 with Paramount Pictures for US$1\u00a0million (equivalent to approximately $ in 2017 dollars).  - The Masquerader is a 1914 film written and directed by Charles Chaplin during his time at The Keystone Company . This film stars Chaplin and Roscoe Arbuckle and has a running time of 13 minutes . It is the tenth film directed and the second written by Chaplin . This is a rare film where we get the chance to see Charlie the actor , Charlie the Tramp , and Charlie as a female impersonator all in one .  - Mabel Normand (November 9, 1892\u00a0 February 23, 1930) was an American silent film actress, screenwriter, director, and producer. She was a popular star and collaborator of Mack Sennett in his Keystone Studios films and, at the height of her career in the late 1910s and early 1920s, had her own movie studio and production company. Onscreen, she appeared in 12 successful films with Charles Chaplin and 17 with Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle, sometimes writing and directing (or co-writing/directing) movies featuring Chaplin as her leading man. Throughout the 1920s, her name was linked with widely publicized scandals, including the 1922 murder of William Desmond Taylor and the 1924 shooting of Courtland S. Dines, who was shot by Normand's chauffeur using her pistol. She was not a suspect in either crime. Her film career declined, possibly due to both scandals and a recurrence of tuberculosis in 1923, which led to a decline in her health, retirement from films, and her death in 1930 at age 37.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'director' with 'charlie chaplin'.\n++++++++\nAnswer:"}], "response": "the masquerader"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Ques: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Title: Man Hunt Movie plot: On July 29, 1939, renowned British big game hunter Captain Alan Thorndike (Walter Pidgeon) slips through the forest undetected near the Berghof, Adolf Hitler's residence near Berchtesgaden. Getting the dictator in his telescopic sight, he pulls the trigger on his unloaded rifle and gives a wave. He ponders a moment, then loads a live round, but is discovered at the last second by a guard, and the shot goes wild.After being beaten up, Thorndike is taken to Major Quive-Smith (George Sanders). Quive-Smith is also a devoted hunter and an admirer of Thorndike. Thorndike explains that it was a \"sporting stalk\", not to kill, but just for the thrill of going after the biggest game of all. The Nazi half-believes him, but insists he sign a confession that he was in fact working for His Majesty's government. When Thorndike refuses, he is tortured, but remains steadfast and warns of \"questions being asked in high places\" if he is killed, as his brother, Lord Risborough (Frederick Worlock), is a very important diplomat. The phrase gives Quive-Smith the idea to have Thorndike thrown off a cliff to make his death look like an accident.Thorndike survives when his knapsack gets caught in a tree, breaking his fall. He eludes his German pursuers and reaches a port. He steals a rowboat, but is forced to abandon it hastily when a patrol boat comes near. He swims to a Danish ship about to sail for London. Vaner (Roddy McDowall), the English cabin boy, helps Thorndike hide. The Germans find Thorndike's coat and passport aboard the rowboat and search the nearby ship. Though they find nothing, they place agent Mr. Jones (John Carradine) on board using Thorndike's passport to continue looking even after the ship leaves the harbor.Jones is met by German agents in London. Thorndike, mistakenly believing he is now safe, casually debarks and is spotted. He manages to shake off his pursuers by ducking into the apartment of Jerry Stokes (Joan Bennett), a young woman.

The British headquarters move to Brideshead, a mansion in the middle of the English countryside, and Charles is one of those in charge. He happens to be the narrator of the story, and while he makes some comments about the uncomfortability of the place and its inadequate geography, he also remembers with fondness his past happiness there.A painter who is showcasing his last South-American jungle-themed collection leaves the party where many East-Coast millionaires are buying his paintings. He sees a woman and goes after her. When she has reached her first-class cabin, she turns and says \"Hello, Charles.\"Flashback to Charles Ryder (Matthew Goode) starting his first year at Cambridge, and his cousin Jasper (Richard Teveron) shows him around. Charles wants to be a painter, but he must study something more practical, so he goes for History. He gets a room in the ground floor of one of the dorms. Even before he has unpacked, a drunk student appears and throws up in the floor. The next day, Charles gets some flowers from that student, Sebastian Flyte (Ben Whishaw) a homosexual English Lord who hangs out with Anthony Blanche (Joseph Beattie) - a flamboyant homosexual as well - and Boy Mulcaster (Mark Field).Sebastian and Charles become friends, but they never fulfill their sexual desire - an unsolved sexual tension grows on between then. Sebastian takes Charles to see Brideshead, the manor mansion of his family, and Nanny (Rita Davies), an elderly lady who has always taken care of Sebastian and who says that she is praying for Sebastian's soul.

On such a rush visit, Charles can only catch glimpses of the paintings at Brideshead. He leaves fascinated and mesmerized with the palace, the views, the art, the ever-obliging servicepeople.

But two government officials said those killed were tribesmen who were taking up arms against the government. The fighting, which occurred in Arhab province just north of Sanaa, is the latest to erupt in Yemen, which has been wracked by insurgent activity and anti-government ferment. One of the government sources, a security official in Arhab, said that clashes erupted when the government ordered the tribes to hand over wanted criminals in the district. When the tribes refused, the government responded with force. \"The tribes are harboring criminals who stand behind the attacks on soldiers,\" the official said. A Defense Ministry official said slain militants \"put law in their own hands and looted governmental property. They were not civilians.\" Eyewitnesses said that guards raided most of the villages in the district, damaging many homes, and residents estimate that more than 240 homes have been destroyed over the last month. \"We were sleeping in our houses when governmental rockets hit our house. We did not raise arms against the government but are still being attacked,\" said Abdul Kareem Mubarak, a resident in Barman village. Republican guards have been clashing with tribesmen in Arhab over the last month. The government also claims that the tribes attempted to seize the military compounds in the district. The security official said that the tribes have injured more than 25 government soldiers during the last two weeks. \"Our soldiers are being attacked. The government is trying to ensure law and order in Arhab district,\" the official said. Residents blame the guards for randomly attacking civilian property in Arhab. \"The guards are attacking anything they see. Everyone is a target and people are displaced,\" said Abdullah Mansour, an Arhab resident who lost his home. This comes after a surge of violence in a western Yemeni city overnight Monday. Supporters of Yemen's president converged on a central square in Hodeidah and killed an anti-government protester and injured more than 150 others, according to witnesses and a medical team member. The fighting around the city's Change Square was the bloodiest since May, and comes as tensions remain high between those who support President Ali Abdullah Saleh and those who have been demanding his ouster for months. Saleh, who was injured in an attack on the presidential palace last month, is now being treated in Saudi Arabia. John Brennan, U.S. President Barack Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, met Monday in Sanaa with Yemeni Vice President Abdu Rabu Mansoor Hadi, according to a report from Yemen's official Saba news agency. Hadi is officially the nation's acting leader, though Saleh has indicated his intention to return to his homeland. Brennan met with Saleh Sunday at a military hospital in Riyadh. Video of the meeting shows the Yemeni president wearing a suit jacket, his face still singed from the June 3 blast. Brennan wished Saleh \"a speedy recovery\" but also \"emphasized the importance of resolving the political crisis in Sanaa,\" the White House said in a statement on Sunday's meeting. He urged Saleh to sign the Gulf Cooperation Council's political transition plan for Yemen, one that mandates that the president leaves the post he has held for many years. Saleh has voiced agreement with the plan brokered by the regional council, but he has not signed it.\nSummarize this article.\n\nAnswer: Several people were wounded in the fighting.

Drivers were left scratching their heads when they saw the two signs showing exactly the same information as each other despite being just metres apart.

Aberdeen: Drivers were scratching their heads. when they saw the two signs with the same information. Just in case you missed it: The company say the existing sign will be moved in the next fortnight. A spokeswoman said: 'A new sign has been put up to accommodate new signage for a U-turn ban and junction warning signs. 'The existing sign that was there originally will be moved in the next fortnight.' The second banner details how far away Stonehaven, Laurencekirk, Brechin, Forfar, Dundee and Perth are from the Granite City. And when asked why the company could. not just move the original sign Bear Scotland said that would deprive. drivers of the necessary information while it was being moved. She added: 'The whole idea is to have two signs so that no information is lost for the motorists while the the move takes place. Two for one: Some drivers questioned their eyesight when they drove past the two identical signs. 'It is normal to put the new sign up before the old one is taken down.'

The game started with the Packers in possession and the Packers started off the game with a nice 14-yard run by RB Ryan Grant for a first down. On the first third down of the drive, Aaron Rodgers completed his first pass of the day to TE Donald Lee for an 11-yard gain. Colts CB Marlin Jackson was flagged for unnecessary roughness after the play and the Colts were penalized 15&#160;yards for the Packers 49 down to the Colts 36-yard line. After a 1-yard run and an incomplete pass on 1st and second downs, Rodgers completed a 6-yard pass to TE Donald Lee on 3rd and 9 but was nullified when Colts CB Tim Jennings was flagged for defensive holding on WR Greg Jennings during the play resulting in a 5-yard penalty and a 1st down. The next play was a run by RB Ryan Grant for 4&#160;yards. Grant fumbled the ball on the play and it looked to be recovered by the Colts, but the ball slipped past the defenders and FB Korey Hall dove onto the ball and recovered the fumble for the Packers. Grant then followed up the play with a 5-yard gain on 2nd down and a surprise hand off to FB John Kuhn on 3rd down and 1 for 3&#160;yards secured another 1st down for the Packers at the Colts 18-yard line. The drive ended with an incomplete pass the WR Ruvell Martin on 3rd down and the Packers were forced to settle for a Mason Crosby 31-yard field goal to take the early 3-0 lead. After the field goal, The Packers attempted to onside kick but the ball went out of bounds after 15&#160;yards. On the retry, Mason Crosby kicked the ball out of bounds again but this time it was much farther down field. The ball was then placed at the Colts 45-yard line but an unnecessary roughness penalty moved the ball back to the Colts 30-yard line. On the Colts first drive, they seemed to be able to move the ball very well with runs by the injured starter  Joseph Addai's replacement Dominic Rhodes paired with a 9-yard pass to TE Dallas Clark. After a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on CB Tramon Williams on 3rd and 1 at the Colts 39, QB Peyton Manning connected with WR Reggie Wayne for a 15-yard gain on the next 3rd down to the GB 16-yard line. RB Dominic Rhodes rushed the ball four consecutive times and capped the drive with a 3-yard rush for the touchdown. The Colts took the 7-3 lead with 4:06 left in the 1st. The Packers second drive of the game started with an Aaron Rodgers pass left to Greg Jennings for 14&#160;yards under soft coverage. Ryan Grant continued rushing the ball better with a nice 7-yard gain on the next play to the Green Bay 41-yard line. Rodgers failed to connect on a pass deep to Greg Jennings on the next play but CB Tim Jennings was flagged for pass interference resulting in a 25-yard penalty down to the Colts 34-yard line. After a couple of short runs by Ryan Grant, Rodgers completed a 7-yard pass to Greg Jennings on 3rd and 6 for the first down. After a Colts neutral zone infraction penalty and a couple more short rush attempts by Ryan Grant, The Packers first touchdown of the game was scored on a 12-yard pass to TE Donald Lee. With a little more than 14&#160;minutes left in the 2nd quarter, the Packers took the 10-7 lead. The Colts continued to attempt to move the ball on their next drive with runs and short passes to the running backs and tight ends but their drive stalled near midfield when Peyton Manning completed a pass to WR Marvin Harrison a-yard short of the first down. It appeared that the Colts were going to keep their offense on the field and go for it on fourth down and 1 but Colts coach Tony Dungy thought otherwise and Peyton Manning left the field with a look of disagreement with his coaches decision. After the punt the Packers offense started their third drive of the day at the Green Bay 11. The Packers quickly got out of the shadows of the goal post with a 24-yard pass to WR Donald Driver to the 35-yard line. After a short 3-yard gain by Ryan Grant and two 3-yard receptions by Donald Driver, the Packers were faced with a 4 and 1 at their own 44-yard line much like the Colts on their previous drive. Instead of punting like the Colts did, the Packers kept their offense on the field a managed to get the first down on a nice 7-yard rush by Ryan Grant. The Packers moved the ball down to the Colts 33-yard line with a few short runs by Ryan Grant mixed with a short pass to RB Brandon Jackson for 9&#160;yards. On 2nd a 7 Rodgers dropped back to pass and looked to throw to WR Greg Jennings but decided to dump the ball off the Brandon Jackson for the second time on the drive but he was tackled for a 1-yard loss. During the play a flag was thrown for illegal use of the hands on CB Tim Jennings who was coving Greg Jennings on the play. After a rush for no gain on 1st down at the Colts 28, Rodgers connected with WR Ruvell Martin for 17&#160;yards to the Colts 11-yard line. The Packers scored their second touchdown of the day on the next play with an 11-yard rush by Ryan Grant. The Packers now held a 17-7 lead with 2:53 left in the half. Now in a ten-point hole, The Colts offense took the field again but could not manage to get a first down. DT Ryan Pickett batted down the pass intended for Marvin Harrison on 3rd down and forced the Colts to punt. With 1:54 remaining in the half the Packers started their final drive of the half on their own 33-yard line. The drive featured many short passes to RB Brandon Jackson for decent gains along with a Rodgers scramble down the middle of the field for a 9-yard gain. The Packers moved the ball down to the Colts 18-yard line and took a time out with 9&#160;seconds left. Mason Crosby attempted a 36-yard field goal but the kick was pushed wide left. The half ended with Peyton Manning taking a knee and the Packers went in the half with a 17-7 lead. The Colts started the second half with possession and managed to move the ball to the Packers 48-yard line, but a pass to Reggie Wayne on 3rd and 6 went through his hands and popped up into the air. FS Nick Collins who was a couple yards behind Wayne was in perfect position to intercept the ball and returned it 62&#160;yards for the touchdown to take the commanding 24-7 lead early in the 3rd. After the interception return the Colts offense took the field and managed to move the ball down to the Packers 28-yard line with a 29-yard pass to TE Dallas Clark. After a 1-yard rush and two incomplete passes the Colt's Adam Vinatieri attempted a 45-yard field goal but it was blocked by DT Johnny Jolly. The Packers took over possession but failed to move the ball and was forced to punt. During the punt, Colts Tim Jennings was flagged for defensive delay of game and the Packers were awarded 5&#160;yards and a 1st down. The Packers then managed to move the ball down to the Colts 11 with some short gains on the ground by Ryan Grant. The highlight of the drive took place when FB Korey Hall received a pass from Aaron Rodgers and hurdled over the oncoming defender. The drive ended when Ryan Grant couldn't get past the 1st down marker on 3rd down and they had to settle for a successful 29-yard field goal by Mason Crosby to extend the lead to 27-7. The Colts managed to get a first down off an illegal contact penalty on 3rd down, but the drive ended with three incomplete passes by Peyton Manning. The Colts punted and the Packers ended the 3rd quarter with 2 rushes by Ryan Grant. The first play of the 4th was an incomplete pass to TE Tory Humphrey and the Packers were forced to punt for the first time of the contest. The Colts again couldn't move the ball on their next possession and were forced to punt, The Packers took over and gain one first down on a pass to Brandon Jackson, but they failed to break into Colts territory and punted for the second time of the contest. With time not on the Colts side, the Colts drove down all the way to the Packers 5-yard line and were looking to score. Manning forced a throw into triple coverage in the end zone to Dallas Clark earlier in the drive and it was almost intercepted by Charles Woodson but S Aaron Rouse batted the ball down before Woodson could secure the pick. Rouse made up for it though 3 plays later when he stepped in front of WR Anthony Gonzalez at the 1-yard line and intercepted the pass. Rouse returned the ball 99&#160;yards for the Packers second interception for a touchdown in the game and 5th of the season. With the score the Packers increased their lead to 34-7 with about 4:30 remaining in the game. In a prevent style defense, the Packers allowed the Colts offense to move down the field to the Green Bay 15. Peyton Manning threw the ball to Anthony Gonzalez at the goal line and he looked to be in for the score. The booth reviewed the catch and the call on the field was reversed. On the next play, Manning completed another pass to Dallas Clark and he dove for the pylon for the score. The booth reviewed the touchdown and again the touchdown wasn't awarded but the ball was placed at the 1-yard line. RB Dominic Rhodes rushed 1-yard for the touchdown to decrease the Packers lead to 34-14. The Colts lined up in an onside kick formation but kicker Adam Vinatieri instead kicked the ball shallow and it was easily caught by Charles Woodson. Ryan Grant rushed for 9&#160;yards on 1st down to put him over the 100-yard mark for the first time this season and two Aaron Rodgers kneel downs sealed the dominating victory. With the win, the Green Bay Packers improved their record to 4-3 going into the bye week. \nQuestion: How many field goals did Mason Crosby miss in the second half? \nAnswer type: Number \nA:"}], "response": "1."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a correct answer to the given question based on its associated fact.

It was part of a large expansion of British territory following the country's victory in the Seven Years' War. Almost the entire Spanish population left, taking along most of the remaining indigenous population to Cuba. The British soon constructed the King's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia. The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British named \"Cow Ford\", both names ostensibly reflecting the fact that cattle were brought across the river there.\nA: Who owned Cuba after the Eight Years War?\nRationale: This question appears to be relevant to the passage as both involves words such as 'Cuba' and 'War' which also exist in the passage. The passage mentions that \"after the war, almost the entire Spanish population left, taking along most of the remaining indigenous population to Cuba\". This information is not sufficient to conclude that which country owned cuba.\nQ: Passage: In the visual arts, the Normans did not have the rich and distinctive traditions of the cultures they conquered. However, in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform, encouraging the Cluniac reform of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits, especially the proliferation of scriptoria and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost illuminated manuscripts. The church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy. The chief monasteries taking part in this \"renaissance\" of Norman art and scholarship were Mont-Saint-Michel, F\u00e9camp, Jumi\u00e8ges, Bec, Saint-Ouen, Saint-Evroul, and Saint-Wandrille. These centres were in contact with the so-called \"Winchester school\", which channeled a pure Carolingian artistic tradition to Normandy. In the final decade of the 11th and first of the 12th century, Normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts, but it was brief and the major scriptoria of Normandy ceased to function after the midpoint of the century.\nA:"}], "response": "What kind of art did the Normans have a rich tradition of?"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please answer the following question: Title: Oh my, a clue!

(September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1625 France, following in his late father's footsteps, d'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell) sets off to Paris in hopes of becoming a member of the Musketeers, a band of men sworn to serve and protect the King of France. d'Artagnan is pursued by G\u00c3\u00a9rard and his brothers, who accuse him of blemishing their sister's honor. G\u00c3\u00a9rard saw his sister kissing d'Artagnan goodbye or as d'Artagnan put it \"she wanted to give me something to remember her by!\" At Musketeer Headquarters, Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the Cardinal's Guards have disbanded the Musketeers as per the orders of Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry), the King's Minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with England. Rochefort confides to the Cardinal that there are three Musketeers that have refused to relinquish their duties: Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charlie Sheen). Upon reaching Paris, the headstrong d'Artagnan has a series of chance physical encounters with these same three Musketeers, resulting in d'Artagnan's accepting a duel with each one that very day. D'Artagnan arrives at the Ruins for his first duel; and, much to his surprise, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reveal themselves as Musketeers. But, before the duels can commence, the Captain of the Cardinal's Guard appears with orders to arrest the resistant Musketeers. Although d'Artagnan himself is not under arrest, he joins the three Musketeers in the ensuing skirmish, aligning himself with them. Displeased (but still impressed) by d'Artagnan's involvement, the Three Musketeers leave d'Artagnan behind. More of the Cardinal's Guards, led by Rochefort, arrive; and d'Artagnan is captured. During an escape attempt, d'Artagnan is able to eavesdrop on a conversation between Cardinal Richelieu and Milady de Winter (Rebecca De Mornay),...

She takes them to a warehouse where fellow mercenaries, German Gregor (Stellan Skarsg\u00c3\u00a5rd) and English Spence (Sean Bean), are waiting. There, Deirdre briefs the men on their mission: they have been hired to attack a heavily armed convoy and steal a large metallic briefcase, the contents of which are never revealed. As the team prepares, Deirdre meets with her ex-IRA handler, Seamus O'Rourke (Jonathan Pryce), who reveals that the Russian mob is bidding for the case and the team must intervene. After Spence is exposed as a fraud by Sam and summarily dismissed, the others depart for Nice. Sam and Deirdre develop an attraction to each other during a stakeout. On the day of the sale, Deirdre's team ambush the convoy at La Turbie and pursue the survivors back to Nice. After a gun battle at the port, Gregor steals the case and disappears. Gregor tries to sell the case to the Russians, but he is forced to kill his contact when he betrays him. He then contacts Mikhi (F\u00c3\u00a9odor Atkine), the Russian mobster in charge of the deal, and makes him agree to another meeting. The rest of the team later track Gregor through one of Sam's old CIA contacts and corner him in the Arles Amphitheatre, where he is meeting two of Mikhi's men. Gregor flees but is captured by Seamus, who kills Larry and escapes with Deirdre. Sam gets shot saving Vincent's life and is taken to a villa in Les Baux-de-Provence owned by Vincent's friend Jean-Pierre (Michael Lonsdale). After removing the bullet and letting Sam recuperate, Vincent asks Jean-Pierre to help them locate Gregor and the Irish. Back in Paris, Gregor is brutally interrogated into leading Seamus and Deirdre to a post office, where they retrieve the case.

Its propeller spins into the films title frame. During the opening credits each of the principal characters is introduced in a film clip from the movie that includes their real name and the character they portray. Then, the same airplane shot is seen; this time its propeller spins into a distant shot of the Hotel Hibiscus in Miami. A sign appears: Hotel Hibiscus, Roger Bond and His Yankee Clipper Band Now Playing in the Date Grove. Mr. Hammerstein (Franklin Pangborn) inspects the hotels chefs, the bellboys and maids. Hammerstein, who has been brought from Switzerland to shape up the hotels staff, seems uncomfortable with one of the buxom maids and isn't pleased with anothers shoe heels that are terribly worn. Next, he wants to inspect the band. The head waiter (Eric Blore) points to the opposite side of the room where the band members are lounging. Honey Hale (Ginger Rogers), the bands female vocalist, greets Hammerstein with, Good morning, Popeye. He reprimands her for speaking before he has asked her a question. Then, he tells the band members that he has had several complaints about them; he is particularly upset that they have been too familiar with the guests. Hammerstein asks where Roger Bond (Gene Raymond), the bands leader, and Bonds assistant, Fred Ayres (Fred Astaire), are. Honey says, Coming right down. The scene switches to a small single engine airplane doing a loop-de-loop before it lands. Once it stops, Fred is the first out; he has to hold on to the struts to keep from falling. There is a small piano in the plane right behind the front seats; Roger uses the instrument to write songs during his flights. Fred and Roger rush to the hotel for a scheduled radio program. At the hotel, Hammerstein is pacing, the band is waiting on the bandstand and everybody is looking at their watches. At the last possible moment, Roger and Fred sneak in from the back of the bandstand, Roger welcomes the radio listeners and introduces their first song,...\n++++++++\nAnswer: Roger Bond\n\ninput question: Question: Who still wanting the diamond? If there is no answer, please output \"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\". Movie title: After the Sunset Context: After the Sunset begins with master thieves Max Burdett (Pierce Brosnan) and his beautiful accomplice, Lola Cirillo (Salma Hayek), retiring to Paradise Island in the Bahamas after one last big score, having lifted the second of the three famous Napoleon diamonds. Their financial future is set, their career in crime a thing of the past. However, Stanley Lloyd (Woody Harrelson), the FBI agent who has spent seven years doggedly pursuing Burdett, only to be foiled time after time, refuses to believe their retreat into domesticity. After a few months, Lloyd shows up, accusing Burdett of hiding out in the same place where a cruise ship is displaying another large rare diamond, the third of a set of diamonds that he stole. He thinks the two are planning to lift the third Napoleon diamond, one of the three largest non-flawed diamonds in the world.When the two adversaries meet up in paradise, Burdett unwittingly turns the tables and befriends the frustrated detective, showing him the pleasures that Paradise Island has to offer. Lloyd, out of his element, adapts quickly to the easy-going Caribbean lifestyle. Despite his pleas of innocence and placing Lloyd in first-class accommodations to show how he doesn't need to steal anything, Burdett's curiosity gets the better of him and he starts casing the ship. However, not only does Lola suspect that he's ready for one more job, so does the local thug, Henri Moor\u00e9 (Don Cheadle), who threatens Burdett to steal the diamond for him.Burdett pretends to work with Moor\u00e9, even giving him a fake plan as to how he would steal the diamond (which he earlier related to Stan). Stan teams up with local police officer Sophie (Naomie Harris) to catch Burdett, and tails him to Junkanoo, a local parade, where Max loses him, warning that he shouldn't tail so closely. Stan and Sophie then have sex, and Lola kicks Max out after realizing his activities. Max is forced to bunk with Stan, and they share their thoughts about each other's lives.

They\u2019re wrong.\n\nThe first teaser trailer of \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" the Disney-backed feature directed by J.J. Abrams, which opens in theaters Dec. 18, 2015. (Disney)\n\nThe new Star Wars trailer has only been out for a couple of hours, and while it's getting mostly positive feedback, there's one moment in particular that keeps attracting attention: The part where a Sith turns on a lightsaber, and then turns on two other lightsabers that act as a crossguard of some kind.\n\nThe crossguard idea purports to solve the problem of an opposing lightsaber sliding down and hitting the defender's hand. Some, like The Verge's T.C. Sottek, argue that even if this is a concern, the way it's been implemented here doesn't actually protect the hand.\n\nAs anyone who's watched the Star Wars movies knows, lightsabers can cut through pretty much anything \u2014 including other lightsabers, as when Obi-Wan Kenobi sliced Darth Maul's double lightsaber in half. So the fact that the crossguard saber leaves a bit of room for an enemy lightsaber to come slicing through the emitter seems to defeat the whole point of the crossguard. And that's silly.\n\nBut hang on. There just may be an explanation for this that makes the crossguard a little less implausible than it might seem.\n\nIn the Star Wars universe, there are certain rare materials that are thought to be lightsaber-resistant. Among these are substances like phrik, cortosis and Mandalorian iron, which have been used to create weapons and armor that can deflect or short-circuit lightsaber beams. There's a precedent for lightsabers made of phrik: Emperor Palpatine's lightsaber was, according to Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith: The Visual Dictionary. In Star Wars video games, cortosis has been shown to block lightsabers, and sometimes shut them down.\n\nMaybe J.J. Abrams has really done his homework on Star Wars technology. Maybe what he's telling us is that this Sith saber is made of one of these resistant materials.\n\nOkay, probably not. It's more likely the producers just made a silly design choice. And of course, even if the crossguard emitters were made of cortosis, why not just make the whole crossguard out of it, too? Seems like that would be easier.\n\nBut until I'm proven otherwise, I'm going to assume the Sith have figured out how to manufacture lightsabers with superpowers.\n\n(Related: Master bladesmith: New lightsaber design is a terrible idea)\n\nBrian Fung covers technology for The Washington Post.\n\nSummary: You just need to get creative with these rare materials.\n\n\nFrance Opens Manslaughter Investigation\n\n(PARIS) \u2014 French authorities opened a manslaughter inquiry Monday into the May crash of an EgyptAir plane that killed 66 people, saying there is no evidence so far to link it to terrorism.\n\nProsecutor\u2019s office spokesman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre said the inquiry was launched as an accident investigation, not a terrorism investigation. She said authorities are \u201cnot at all\u201d favoring the theory that the plane was downed deliberately, though the status of the inquiry could eventually change if evidence emerges to that effect.\n\nInvestigators decided to start the probe before waiting to analyze the plane\u2019s flight data and voice recorders, based on evidence gathered so far, she said, without elaborating.\n\nEgyptAir Flight 804, an Airbus A320 en route from Paris to Cairo, slammed into the Mediterranean on May 19. The reason for the crash remains unclear. The pilots made no distress call, and no group has claimed to have brought down the aircraft.\n\nSearch teams have recovered its two flight recorders, but they suffered damage and Egyptian investigators were unable to download information from the so-called black boxes. The recorders\u2019 memory cards arrived Monday in Paris, Egyptian investigators said. Technicians at France\u2019s air accident investigation agency, the BEA, will attempt to clean and repair them, and then send them back to Egypt for analysis, the BEA said in a statement Friday.\n\nWhile the plane was Egyptian and crashed in Egyptian waters, France can also investigate because the plane was manufactured by France-based Airbus and French citizens were among those killed.\n\nSummary: Authorities say there is no evidence so far to link the crash to terrorism\n\n\nWho's Behind That Political Ad? This App Tells You\n\nYou know the ultra-useful Shazam and SoundHound apps that let you hold your cellphone up to a speaker to instantly identify the song title and artist? A new app released Wednesday is doing exactly the same thing \u2014 but for political ads instead of music.\n\nCalled \u201cSuper PAC App,\u201d the app uses audio recognition technology to identify political advertisements. Then, it provides users with a wealth of information about the ad: What campaign or organization made it, how much it cost and how accurate the claims made in the ad actually are. It also lets users rate the ads with a variety of responses, including \u201clove,\u201d \u201cfair,\u201d \u201cfishy\u201d and \u201cfail.\u201d\n\nCurious users can also use the app to check out political ads being run in other states \u2014 Iowans can check in on Ohio, New Yorkers can get a feel for the message being pushed in Florida, and so on.\n\nSuper PAC App was created by Jennifer Hollett and Dan Siegel, and is the product of a class project at MIT\u2019s Media Lab. The pair are hoping the app builds an engaged community around the app, full of users submitting new ads they\u2019ve spotted on the web or on TV.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to get regular people using this app \u2014 not just journalists and policy wonks, but regular people using it because it\u2019s informative and fun to use,\u201d said Hollett. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget the presidential election is about regular people. We\u2019re hoping our app changes that.\u201d\n\nSuper Pac App\u2019s database gets the vast majority of its videos from YouTube, as even ads designed for very specific television markets are getting uploaded online this election cycle.\n\n\u201cThe minute an ad goes on YouTube, it gets pulled down automatically [by Super PAC App],\u201d said Siegel.\n\nWhile data about official campaign ads is relatively easy to get, SuperPACs aren\u2019t required to report how much they spent on a particular ad. Accordingly, Siegel acknowledged that the data provided by the app may be sometimes incomplete.\n\n\u201cOur data can only be as good as the [Federal Elections Commission] requires organizations to share their data,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re plugged into the FEC firehose. When it\u2019s streaming water, we\u2019re getting it. But when it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not much we can do.\u201d\n\nFor now, Super PAC App is iPhone-only. Siegel and Hollett are, however, considering a desktop browser plug-in for the platform.\n\nSuper PAC App is available for download in the App Store.

Although the Wing Chun master Ip Man is the most skilled martial artist in Foshan, he is unassuming and keeps a low profile. As an independent wealthy man, he feels no need to accept any disciples and instead spends his days training, meeting with friends, and spending time with his family. However, his wife is often resentful of the time he spends training and discussing martial arts with friends and colleagues. Though not a professional martial artist, Ip is respected in Foshan due to the abilities he displays in friendly, closed-door competitions with local masters. Ip's reputation is further enhanced when he defeats an aggressive, rude, highly skilled Northern Chinese martial arts master, Jin Shanzhao, thus upholding the regional pride of fellow Southern stylists and others in Foshan. The Japanese invasion in 1937 adversely affects the life of everyone in Foshan. Ip's house is claimed by the Japanese and used as their Foshan headquarters. Ip and his family lose their wealth and are forced to move into a decrepit house. Desperate to support his family, Ip accepts work at a coal mine. The Japanese General Miura, who is a Karate master, establishes an arena where Chinese martial artists compete with his military trainees. The Chinese earn a bag of rice for every match they win. Li Zhao, a former police officer and Ip's acquaintance, is now working as a translator for the Japanese and is making the offer to the martial artists working at the coal mine. Ip at first declines to participate in the matches. However, when his friend Lin goes missing, he agrees to take part in order to investigate. Ip arrives to see fellow Foshan martial arts master Liu executed by Miura's lieutenant, Sato, for picking up a bag of rice from a prior victory after conceding in a second match against three karateka.

After six hours of questioning the cop, Officer Gina Santer, and Detective 'Bub' Bailey let him go, but instruct him to turn over any information he obtains on the client that claimed Santer was his wife. Most of the info on file at Strachey Investigations about this mystery client is fake.Meanwhile, at the home of Dorothy 'Dot' Fisher and her partner Edith Strong, Dorothy chases out a vandal after he breaks into their home and spray paints homophobic graffiti on their wall. The next day, Andrew McWhirter, close friend of Fisher and Strongand Timmy Callhan's former boyfriend introduce Donald and Timmy to the lesbian couple after a contentious school board meeting at which Dorothy, a guidance counselor at the school, is placed on paid leave due to objections from a homophobic parent whose gay son Derek has been counseled by Fisher.

Movie title: College Context: After Kevin (Drake Bell), a high school senior, gets dumped by his girlfriend Gina (Alona Tal) for being too boring, he doesn't want to go to the freshman orientation weekend at Fieldmont University, where they had planned to go together. But his best friends Carter (Andrew Caldwell) and Morris (Kevin Covais) convince him that the weekend away will help get his mind off her. Once there, one of the rowdiest Fraternities and sororities fraternities on campus pretends to recruit them as pledges in return for granting them access to the college party scene. Though forced to put up with the disgusting antics of fraternity brothers Teague (Nick Zano), Bearcat (Gary Owen), and Cooper (Zach Cregger), the guys meet sorority girls Kendall (Haley Bennett), Heather (Camille Mana), and Amy (Nathalie Walker), and sparks fly. But once Teague feels threatened by Kevin's new relationship with Kendall, he takes the pre-frosh humiliation to a greater level, forcing the guys to decide to fight back.\n\nA:"}], "response": "no"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Q: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Working with a group of baboons  in the Namibian desert, Dr. Alecia Carter of the Department of Zoology,Cambridge University set baboons learning tasks involving a novel food and a familiar food hidden in a box. Some baboons were given the chance to watch another baboon who already knew how to solve the task, while others had to learn for themselves. To work out how brave or anxious the baboons were, Dr. Carter presented them either with a novel food or a threat in the form of a model of a poisonous snake. She found that personality had a major impact on learning. The braver baboons learnt, but the shy ones did not learn the task although they watched the baboon perform the task of finding the novel food just as long as the brave ones did. In effect, despite being made aware of what to do, they were still too shy to do what the experienced baboon did. The same held true for anxious baboons compared with calm ones. The anxious individuals learnt the task by observing others while those who were relaxed did not, even though they spent more time watching. This _ between collecting social information and using it shows that personality plays a key role in social learning in animals, something that has previously been ignored in studies on how animals learn to do things. The findings are significant because they suggest that animals may perform poorly in cognitive ( )tasks not because they aren't clever enough to solve them,but because they are too shy or nervous to use the social information. The findings may impact how we understand the formation of culture in societies through social learning. If some individuals are unable to get information from others because they don't associate with the knowledgeable individuals,or they are too shy to use the information once they have it,information may not travel between all group members, preventing the formation of a culture based on social learning.\nA: Question: According to the research, which baboons are more likely to complete a new learning task?Options:A Those that have more experience.B Those that can avoid potential risks.C Those that like to work independently.D Those that feel anxious about learning.Answer:D\n\nQuestion: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: BOGOTA (Reuters) -- Colombian mobile telephone users are being tricked by criminals who pretend to be phone operators and instruct them to turn off their cellphones just long enough to demand a large amount of money from their families. prefix = st1 /Colombia has seen a large number of cases in which mobile phone customers receive messages telling them to turn off their cellphones for two hours because their telephones havebeen cloned, police say.

The new course covers photos, slide shows and documentaries on the magnificence of the world heritage sites. The class aims to tell children what world heritage is and why and how it should be protected. A total of 177 nations, including China, have signed the Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage. Listed are 754 sites all over the world, of which 29 are in China--the third most after Spain and Italy. Currently, protection of the country's cultural and natural resources leaves much to be desired. Education is undoubtedly the best way to  _ people's sense for protecting cultural and natural resources. The introduction of such a programme in Chinese classrooms will certainly help our young people realize the significance of common heritage, learning about world heritage sites, the history and traditions of different cultures, ecology, and the importance of protecting biological and cultural diversity. More importantly, it will help cultivate a sense of responsibility in the minds of young participants. This is critical in protecting these cultural and natural legacies, as well as our living environment and the limited resources for sustainable development.\n****\n[A]: Question: What can you expect to learn at the classes?Options:A What world heritage is.B why we should protect heritage.C How world heritage should be protected.D All of the above.Answer:D\n\nQuestion: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Why do some people live to be older than others? You know the standard explanations: keeping a moderate diet, engaging in regular exercise, etc. But what effect does your personality have on your longevity ? Do some kinds of personalities lead to longer lives? A new study in theJournal of the American Geriatrics Societylooked at this question by examining the personality characteristics of 246 children of people who had lived to be at least 100. The study shows that those living the longest are more outgoing, more active and less neurotic   than other people. Long-living women are also more likely to be sympathetic and cooperative than women with a normal life span. These findings are in agreement with what you would expect from the evolutionary theory: those who like to make friends and help others can gather enough resources to make it through tough times. Interestingly, however, other characteristics that you might consider advantageous had no impact on whether study participants were likely to live longer. Those who were more self-disciplined, for instance, were no more likely to live to be very old. Also, being open to new ideas had no relationship to long life, which might explain all those bad-tempered old people who are fixed in their ways. Whether you can successfully change your personality as an adult is the subject of a longstanding psychological debate. But the new paper suggests that if you want long life, you should strive to be as outgoing as possible. Unfortunately, another recent study shows that your mother's personality may also help determine your longevity. That study looked at nearly 28,000 Norwegian mothers and found that those moms who were more anxious, depressed and angry were more likely to feed their kids unhealthy diets. Patterns of childhood eating can be hard to break when we're adults, which may mean that kids of depressed moms end up dying younger. Personality isn't destiny , and everyone knows that individuals can learn to change. But both studies show that long life isn't...\nAnswer:"}], "response": "Question: What can we learn from the findings of the two new studies?Options:A Anxiety and depression more often than not cut short one's life span.B Longevity results from a combination of mental and physical health.C Personality plays a decisive role in how healthy one is.D Health is in large part related to one's lifestyle.Answer:B"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Le plus ancien d\u2019entre eux a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 l\u2019eau en 1986 et mis en service en 1990; le plus r\u00e9cent a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 l\u2019eau en 1989 et mis en service en 1993.\n\nCould you please translate this to English?\n"}], "response": "The oldest boat was launched in 1986 and commissioned in 1990, while the newest was launched in 1989 and commissioned in 1993."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "In this task, you are given inputs i,j, and A, where i and j are integers and A is a list.

Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13  cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \"textbook\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean.  Now, I have a new situation: A scuba diver is currently exploring the ocean floor. During the day she happens upon two different ocean basins. For some reason, both have signs next to each basin indicating how old they are. According to the signs, basin D is significantly older than basin F. The scuba diver decides to explore basin F first and then will look around in basin D on her return trip.  Answer this question please: Which basin is shallower?\nAns: basin F\n\nI can use this background: Circadian rhythms are regular changes in biology or behavior that occur in a 24-hour cycle. In humans, for example, blood pressure and body temperature change in a regular way throughout each 24-hour day. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock . This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours.  Now, I have a new situation: Jason is an average guy who goes to work each day, lives in an apartment, exercises sometimes, goes out and drinks some weekends and just generally enjoys life. Brad, however, has chosen to live in a dark cave that has no windows. He lives in a cave that has almost no light except for some candles he lights from time to time. If he needs food or supplies, he pays someone to go get them, and they slide them through a hole that can open in the steel door at the entrance of the cave.  Answer this question please: Is the chance Brad feels sleepy after the sun goes down higher or lower than Jason's chance?\nAns: lower\n\nI can use this background: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations under control. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. Protozoa are also important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms.  Now, I have a new situation: George is investigating some algae that has recently started growing in his pond. He wants to find something ti prevent it from overtaking the pond as it makes it very hard to see under the water. After a bit of research he finds a protozoa that can help him.  Answer this question please: Given George all of a sudden notices an increase of insects in the pond, are the insects likely eating the protozoa or the algae?\nAns: protozoa\n\nI can use this background: Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions. The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease.  With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1]  Now, I have a new situation: Two neighboring countries with similar economies, followed different political and economical agendas. Niger developed its infrastructure and communications technology, while Nigeria didn't.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  On October 4, 2011, Dylan's label, Egyptian Records, released an album of previously unheard Hank Williams songs, The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams. Dylan had helped to curate this project, in which songs unfinished when Williams died in 1953 were completed and recorded by a variety of artists, including Dylan himself, his son Jakob Dylan, Levon Helm, Norah Jones, Jack White, and others.On May 29, 2012, U.S. President Barack Obama awarded Dylan a Presidential Medal of Freedom in the White House. At the ceremony, Obama praised Dylan's voice for its \"unique gravelly power that redefined not just what music sounded like but the message it carried and how it made people feel\".On September 11, 2012, Dylan released his 35th studio album, Tempest. The album features a tribute to John Lennon, \"Roll On John\", and the title track is a 14-minute song about the sinking of the Titanic. Reviewing Tempest for Rolling Stone, Will Hermes gave the album five out of five stars, writing: \"Lyrically, Dylan is at the top of his game, joking around, dropping wordplay and allegories that evade pat readings and quoting other folks' words like a freestyle rapper on fire.\" Hermes called Tempest \"one of [Dylan's] weirdest albums ever\", and opined, \"It may also be the single darkest record in Dylan's catalog.\" The critical aggregator website Metacritic awarded the album a score of 83 out of 100, indicating \"universal acclaim\".On August 27, 2013, Columbia Records released Volume 10 of Dylan's Bootleg Series, Another Self Portrait (1969\u20131971).

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Chinnerys were wealthy and influential. William Chinnery's father, also named William, owned trading ships and named one Gilwell in 1800. William and Margaret Chinnery initially resided in London, and after three years of marriage and inheriting Gilwell in 1792, they moved to Gilwell in 1793. They soon shocked the populace by renaming Osborne Hall to \"Gilwell Hall\". William Chinnery expanded Gilwell's land holdings through significant purchases over 15 years and, with his wife, transformed it into a country estate with gardens, paths, and statues. Parts of the garden, paths, and dwelling modifications exist into the 21st century. William Chinnery was exposed as the embezzler of a small fortune from the British Treasury where he worked and was dismissed from all his posts on 12 March 1812. Margaret Chinnery was forced to sign over Gilwell Estate to the Exchequer on 2 July 1812.The Chinnery family was prominent enough that members of the English nobility visited often during the 1790s and early 19th century. King George III visited on occasion, and the Prince Regent, who later became George IV, was a regular visitor. George III's seventh son, Prince Adolphus, became a family friend, lived at Gilwell for a while, and tutored their eldest son George.Gilpin Gorst bought the estate in 1815 at public auction, and his son sold it to Thomas Usborne in 1824. When London Bridge was replaced in 1826, Usborne bought pieces of the stone balustrades, which date to 1209, and erected them behind the White House around the Buffalo Lawn. The estate changed ownership more times, but these families did not maintain the property and it fell into disrepair by 1900. Reverend Cranshaw, a local resident, bought the estate in 1911 and was the last owner prior to the Boy Scout Association, as it was then known.\n****\n[A]:"}], "response": "William"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "OPTIONS:\n A).

Asked about critics accusing the administration of using children as \"pawns\" to demand legislative actions from Congress, the DHS secretary replied, \"I say that is a very cowardly response,\" adding it is clearly within Congress' power \"to make the laws and change the laws. They should do so.\" Trump's Republican party controls both chambers in Congress, and the family border policies were set by his administration.

Waters told supporters, \"If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.\" The most prominent Democrat in the House of Representatives, however, disagreed with Walters. \"Trump's daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable,\" Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Twitter on Monday. \"As we go forward, we must conduct elections in a way that achieves unity from sea to shining sea.\" Pelosi's tweet included a link to a CNN story about Waters encouraging harassment of Trump administration officials. Trump also responded to Water's remarks, saying on Twitter that the congresswoman \u2014 whom he referred to as an \"extraordinarily low IQ person\" \u2014 had called for his supporters to be harassed. In the social media message, the president concluded, \"Be careful what you wish for Max!\" Last week, protesters yelled at Department of Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen at an upscale Mexican restaurant near the White House. Earlier, Nielsen publicly defended the policy of separating children from parents who were apprehended for illegally entering the U.S., a policy the president has since reversed. Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller, also an immigration hard-liner, was called a \"fascist\" while dining at a Mexican cantina in a neighborhood in the District of Columbia. The incident involving Sanders took place Friday night at the Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Virginia, 300 kilometers south of the U.S. capital. \"I explained that the restaurant has certain...

Jon had spent eight seasons breaking this ground to plant spring's crops and every year it got harder. Sweat beaded on his brow and he felt his cotton shirt stick to his skin under his coat. Jon took off his soft-brimmed hat and wiped his forehead. He examined the hat as he let his breath return. The hat had kept the burning sun and beating rain off his head for as long as Jon owned the farm. He wore it every day. It had been a gift given to him on the day he married Alasandra but he could not remember who gave it to him. Jon put it back on his head and pushed the tiller deep into the stubborn earth. Daven ran over the hill and down the cart path leading to their small cobblestone house. The boy had only left a short while ago and he held no sack with the bread and cheese his mother had told him to buy. Jon furrowed his brow. The boy continued to run and soon the wind carried his cry to his father's ears. \"Papa! A carriage is coming! Two horses!\" Jon's furrowed brow remained. Surely the boy meant a cart from a neighboring farm. No carriage made it out this far. \"It's from the city! A soldier drives it!\" Jon felt ice water flow over him. He turned to the house. \"Sandra! Get the musket out of the pantry!\" Jon saw his wife's face appear at one foggy window. Jon gestured wildly at her. \"Get it!\" They were too late. As Daven reached Jon, the black carriage already approached. A single figure sat on the bench, guiding the two brown horses down Jon's path. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Who warned Jon about the carriage? Options: - Alasandra - not enough information - the wind - Daven\n\nAns:"}], "response": "Daven"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "the first sizable relief convoy rolled into iraq in the middle of a sandstorm wednesday as u.s. and british forces struggled to clear the way for more aid shipments , using dolphins to remove mines from waterways and trying to subdue iraqi fighters in basra .\n\nWrite a brief summary in a sentence or less.\n"}], "response": "relief convoys roll into kuwait iraq as allies struggle to clear the way for more"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "In this task, you are given a sentence with a missing word that can be an object, a person, and/or an action.

Donald Trump and  Chris Christie  campaign in 2016. (Photo: John Minchillo  AP)\nI recall  Chris Christie\u2019s  first interview with our editorial board after he won the 2009 election. We asked what had changed in his life now that he was governor of New Jersey.\nMore:  Chris Christie  polishes  his  Trump brand as the swamp beckons\nMore:  Chris Christie  on the beach: New Jersey had a bad day  why should he suffer?\nThe governor\u2019s fight against opioid abuse won him national praise. But the standing ovation really should go to the Christie who pushed for drug courts  treatment over incarceration and the near elimination of cash bail. No other governor could have done so much to right the scales of justice for minorities and low-income defendants. None of this is sexy to voters in national primaries  which makes these initiatives so much more important in judging all that was  Christie . He was capable of being a great leader.\nThen came Superstorm Sandy\u2014 the event that made  Christie  a national figure even as it pretty much set in motion everything that destroyed him. It fed his ego. The national attention he received in his blue fleece telling someone to get off the beach  the bombast that was akin to a happy King Lear  not howling at the wind  but pushing the wind back. He seemed invincible.\nAfter Sandy  Christie was a rising Republican star. Everything he did was now seen through a rosy prism. He was the Republican governor of a blue state getting things done. To be clear: New Jersey is neither blue nor red. It\u2019s madras. Tom Kean  Christie Whitman \u2014 Republicans had won statewide before. New Jersey wanted a reformer in 2009 and  Christie  seemed to fit that bill.\nThe most telling moment from  Christie\u2019s  final State of the State address this month was a sentence he ad-libbed. The prepared text read: \u201cWe ran to be a Governor who did not just mark time. We ran to win and to be a Governor of consequence.\u201d What  Christie  said during the speech was  \u201cI ran to win. I always ran to win. I ran to be a governor of consequence.\u201d\nThat\u2019s it in a nutshell. The fatal flaw. A chief executive consumed with winning who would assemble a team consumed with his winning. It explains more than anything how Bridgegate could come to pass  how a smart  politically savvy man like  Christie  could put so many of the wrong people in high-profile jobs. Did he know before the George Washington Bridge lane closures  during the lane closures or shortly after the lane closures that created a massive four-day traffic jam? At this point it matters less than that he always knew too many people on his team were capable of being punitive  petty and destructive in the cause of  Christie  winning.\n Christie  tried to minimize the scandal.  He  wasted millions of taxpayer dollars on a whitewash report prepared by high-priced lawyers.  He  bled NJ Transit dry.\n He  bullied.  He  baited. And just as Sandy had made  him  a star  Bridgegate made  him  a pariah. Not all at once. But by the time  he  left New Jersey to raise money for Republican governors across the nation and then to openly pursue the presidency   he  was already failing in New Jersey.\nI once was as close to a Christie cheerleader as  he  could find in the New Jersey media. There was a time when I believed  he  was the real deal.  He  was funny  well informed and enjoyed a vigorous debate on issues \u2014 at least off the record.\nThe brilliance of  Christie  remains somewhere inside him  but he was not the greatest natural politician I will ever see. The greatest natural politician would never forget that he was entirely dependent on the charity of others \u2014 voters.  Christie  once told a young man at a town hall who asked how to get into politics that you first have to ask people for their votes. He said a candidate had to recognize that voters could choose anyone they wanted  that receiving a vote was a gift.\nThe governor forgot that lesson or  as his ratings tanked  decided it no longer mattered. He became more important than anything. It was not about New Jersey winning  but  Christie  winning.\nVoters elected  Christie  to serve until Jan. 16  2018  but he checked out on Election Day 2013.\nExample Output: Neutral\n\nExample Input: What is the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Tyra Patterson ?

She was one of five people charged with killing Lai and robbing her sister and three other girls.\n Patterson  did not fire the shot that killed Lai  but under Ohio law accomplices can get the same punishment as killers.\nCelebrity supporters of  her  innocence claims included documentary filmmaker Ken Burns  actress Alfre Woodard and \u201cMad Men\u201d TV show creator Matthew Weiner.\n Patterson  was granted parole in October.  She  was being held at the Northeast Pre-Release Center in Cleveland.\nExample Output: Positive\n\nExample Input: What is the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Michael Simon ? On a whim  Michael Simon sprinted off to Hungary after finishing business school in St. Louis. Twenty years later  he has carved out an unusual niche as perhaps Hungary's most successful software entrepreneur.\n Simon's latest creation to bubble out of Budapest is LogMeIn  a 400-worker outfit that makes software that allows one computing device to take control of another. Using this technology  a person can tap into a home or office PC while on the road with a laptop. Customer support technicians also use LogMeIn's products to take control of people's machines and fix their PC problems.\n Simon's Hungarian tale started in 1992 after he finished business school at Washington University. While pursuing an internship  an opportunity popped up in Budapest.\n \"I bought the Lonely Planet guide to Eastern Europe on a shoestring \" Simon recalled. \"It described Budapest as the Paris of Eastern Europe  and I thought  'That sounds good.\"'\n In Budapest  Simon discovered a wealth of smart engineers fresh out of school and hungry for opportunities -- for relatively modest wages.\n He ended up running a software firm that contracted with companies outsourcing their engineering work. Then in 1995 he founded Uproar  a software company that built Web versions of games like Family Feud and bingo.\n Simon kept in touch with the engineering team that had managed to make the most of limited computing power and turned to them again when Marton Anka  a Hungarian software engineer  approached him with the remote access software he had been selling out of his apartment.\n A closely held piece of technology  nicknamed Gravity  lets the company handle all these connections at a lower cost than other companies can  Simon said.\n \"You can think of Gravity as sort of a connectomatic \" he said. \"We can serve hundreds of millions of devices from an extraordinarily small number of computers.\"\nExample Output:"}], "response": "Positive\n\n"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "How is \"Impact of the crisis on Asia AND THE Pacific\" said in French?\n"}], "response": "IMPACT DE LA CRISE SUR LA R\u00c9GION DE L'ASIE ET DU PACIFIQUE"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Teacher:In this task, you are given a review of a movie and a boolean question whether this review has positive sentiment or negative sentiment.

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a device for applying a meltable material with a source and a heat distribution.  It is preferably used for laboratory preparation of printed circuit boards, for rapid repair  small defects in surface metal layers and in artistic metalwork.  Currently, the deposition of fusible materials is accomplished by melting the fusible material  at the point of application by an external heat source. The disadvantage of these devices is uneven  spot heating of the meltable material and inaccurate regulation of the thickness and width of the applied  fusible material. To precede the pattern that is not to be etched, it is in the laboratory  the preparation of the printed circuit board uses a quick-drying lacquer applied with a tubular pen or  brush. To achieve sufficiently wide joints, the pattern must be pulled several times. By  the work becomes lengthy and inaccurate because the line width is not the same.  These drawbacks are remedied by a device for applying meltable materials with a source a  the heat distribution according to the invention, which consists in the fact that it is formed by a container provided with it  the outlet tube. A control valve is formed at the bottom of the outlet tube  for controlling the amount of molten material flowing out, the lower end of the outlet tube  it can be further provided with a replaceable attachment.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  The Nitrogen Cycle Getting nitrogen into the living world is difficult. Plants and phytoplankton are not equipped to incorporate nitrogen from the atmosphere (which exists as tightly bonded, triple covalent N2) even though this molecule comprises approximately 78 percent of the atmosphere. Nitrogen enters the living world via free-living and symbiotic bacteria, which incorporate nitrogen into their macromolecules through nitrogen fixation (conversion of N2). Cyanobacteria live in most aquatic ecosystems where sunlight is present; they play a key role in nitrogen fixation. Cyanobacteria are able to use inorganic sources of nitrogen to \u201cfix\u201d nitrogen. Rhizobium bacteria live symbiotically in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, beans, and peanuts) and provide them with the organic nitrogen they need. Free-living bacteria, such as Azotobacter, are also important nitrogen fixers. Organic nitrogen is especially important to the study of ecosystem dynamics since many ecosystem processes, such as primary production and decomposition, are limited by the available supply of nitrogen. As shown in Figure 46.17, the nitrogen that enters living systems by nitrogen fixation is successively converted from organic nitrogen back into nitrogen gas by bacteria. This process occurs in three steps in terrestrial systems: ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. First, the ammonification process converts nitrogenous waste from living animals or from the remains of dead animals.

Myelin is a lipid produced by a type of a glial cell known as a Schwann cell. The myelin sheath acts like a layer of insulation, similar to the plastic that encases an electrical cord.

Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance \u2013 to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D...

But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. \u201cI will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,\u201d Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. \u201cThere has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.\u201d Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. \u201cIt rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,\u201d warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump\u2019s base is largely sticking with him.

Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn\u2019t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime\u2019s instagram (she\u2019s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don\u2019t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I\u2019d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly\u2019s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings.

With the addition of Donny, the group became known as The Osmonds, and enjoyed its greatest success as both a boy band and a hard rock ensemble.\nContext: Donny, and to a lesser extent, Marie and Jimmy, soon began to emerge as solo artists. Jimmy was becoming \"big in Japan\", and in 1972 had a #1 hit in the United Kingdom with \"Long Haired Lover from Liverpool\". Marie, then 13 years old, hit #1 on the US country chart in 1973 with \"Paper Roses\" (a song originally recorded by Anita Bryant a decade prior). Donny had a string of pop hits with a string of covers of earlier teen-pop songs, including \"Go Away Little Girl\" (#1, originally by Steve Lawrence), \"Puppy Love\" (#3, a Paul Anka composition) and \"The Twelfth of Never\" (#8, originally recorded by Johnny Mathis). From 1971 to 1976, he had 12 Top 40 hits, including 5 in the Top 10; for most of these, the Osmonds were still performing as a full band, but backing and giving star billing to Donny for songs on which he sang lead.  Donny's popularity, and his numerous solo hits, have led many to assume he was the group's lead. Merrill was nevertheless the usual lead singer; Donny would usually sing the choruses on songs billed to The Osmonds, thus being a \"co-lead\". (The family resemblance between Donny and Merrill at the time likely made the confusion worse; in later years, Merrill grew out his beard and let his hair go gray to distinguish the two.) Donny's emergence as a solo star and the record company's desire to appeal to the teen-girl audience often thrust Donny out in front of the group.  By now the family was touring, recording, creating and producing for five technically separate artists: The Osmonds, Donny Osmond, Marie Osmond and Jimmy Osmond -- plus Donny and Marie had begun recording duets and had hits with \"I'm Leaving It Up to You\" (#4) and \"Morning Side of the Mountain\" (#8). Through all the stress and pressures created by these many efforts, the family hung together. The 2001 ABC-TV movie Inside the Osmonds depicts the family mottoes as being \"It doesn't matter who's out front, as long as it's an Osmond\" family, faith, and career. In that order\".  The original Osmonds as a group still produced hits. In 1974, \"Love Me for a Reason\" reached #10 in the US and #1 in the UK. The Irish boy band Boyzone took the song to #2 in the UK in 1994.\nQuestion: Did they ever come back and do an album together?\n\nAnswer:"}], "response": "The original Osmonds as a group still produced hits."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "[Q]: What type of details about jeong mi-sook  can be gathered from the following bio?

Hell, I even plan several of my meals around having Chipotle, so that I can maximize my delicious burrito-bowl eating opportunities. That being said, shortly after landing in Madison, of all the places, this HAD to be my first stop.   It sucked.   The workers here are more grouchier than your typical chipotle employee. You literally have 5 seconds to shout out your order before the workers give you a look so disdainful you might think you just kicked a basket full of baby kittens. Ugh, the pressure! Not to mention they scoop out your food and throw it in the bowl with such force, it's no wonder that the food portion is so small! Most of it ends up outside of the bowl, and you're left with an order half the size of what you'd get at any other location.  I get it, it's a college town, and no doubt most of the employees are college students. I've been there.

While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases. \nStory: As a part of his engineering job Keith is measuring the vapor pressure of two locomotives, engine A and engine B. \nEngine A has a high vapor pressure, but engine B has a low vapor pressure.

In 1933, Lewis Tater, an aspiring novelist who harbors dreams of becoming the next Zane Grey, decides to leave his family home in Iowa to go to the University of Titan in Nevada so he can soak up the western atmosphere. He arrives to find that there is no university, only a mail order correspondence course scam run by two crooks out of the local hotel. He tries to spend the night at the hotel, but is attacked by one of the men in an attempted robbery. He escapes his attacker, grabs his suitcase, and steals their car to get away, but after awhile   it runs out of gas. He looks in the car trunk, and finds a toolbox containing a revolver and ammunition. Afraid the two crooks are still in pursuit of him, he takes the tool box and his suitcase and walks off into the desert.  Wandering and exhausted, the next morning he happens upon a threadbare film-unit from Tumbleweed Productions grinding out a \"B\" western. Later that day, he catches a lift with the cowboy actors to Los Angeles. After applying for work at Tumbleweed, he is referred by crusty old extra Howard Pike to the Rio, a western-themed restaurant. While washing dishes at the Rio, he is called by Tumbleweed, where Howard mentors him to be an actor. After proving himself as a stuntman, unit manager Kessler offers him a speaking role. Tater then falls in love with spunky script girl Miss Trout. Meanwhile, the crooks trace him to Los Angeles to retrieve the safe-box containing their money that was in the car stolen by Lewis.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe answer is:\nHoward\ninput question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who created photo portraits of painters Piet Mondrian and Marc Chagall, the writer Colette, and film-maker Sergei Eisenstein? , can you please find it?   Kert\u00e9sz emigrated to Paris in September 1925, leaving behind his mother, his unofficial fianc\u00e9e Elizabeth, both brothers, and his uncle Hoffman, who died shortly afterward. Jen\u0151 later emigrated to Argentina. Elizabeth Kert\u00e9sz remained until her future husband was well enough established in Paris that they could marry. Kert\u00e9sz was among numerous Hungarian artists who emigrated during these decades, including Fran\u00e7ois Kollar, Robert Capa, Emeric Feh\u00e9r, Brassa\u00ef, and Julia Bathory. Man Ray, Germaine Krull and Lucien Aigner also emigrated to Paris during this period. Initially Kert\u00e9sz took on commissioned work for several European magazines, gaining publication of his work in Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain. Soon after arriving in Paris, Kert\u00e9sz changed his first name to Andr\u00e9, which he kept for the rest of his life. In Paris he found critical and commercial success.  In 1927 Kert\u00e9sz was the first photographer to have a one-man exhibition; Jan Slivinsky presented 30 of his photographs at the \"Sacre du Printemps Gallery\". Kert\u00e9sz had become connected with members of the growing Dada movement. Paul Derm\u00e9e dubbed him \"Brother Seer\" and \"Brother Seeing Eye\" during his first solo exhibit, alluding to a medieval monastery where all the monks were blind bar one. Over the next years, Kert\u00e9sz was featured in both solo exhibits and group shows. In 1932 at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York, the price of Kert\u00e9sz's proofs was set at US$20 ($ 367 in 2019), a large sum of money during the Great Depression.Kert\u00e9sz and other Hungarian artists formed a synergistic circle; he was featured in exhibits with some of them later in his life.  Visiting his sculptor friends, he was fascinated by the Cubism movement.  He created photo portraits of painters Piet Mondrian and Marc Chagall, the writer Colette, and film-maker Sergei Eisenstein. In 1928, Kert\u00e9sz switched from using plate-glass cameras to a Leica. This period of work was one of his most productive; he was photographing daily, with work divided between magazine...???\noutput answer: Kert\u00e9sz\nPlease answer this: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who wrote a letter to Major Thomas Trafford? , can you please find it?   William Hulton, the chairman of the magistrates watching from the house on the edge of St Peter's Field, saw the enthusiastic reception that Hunt received on his arrival at the assembly, and it encouraged him to action. He issued an arrest warrant for Henry Hunt, Joseph Johnson, John Knight, and James Moorhouse. On being handed the warrant the Constable, Jonathan Andrews, offered his opinion that the press of the crowd surrounding the hustings would make military assistance necessary for its execution. Hulton then wrote two letters, one to Major Thomas Trafford, the commanding officer of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry Cavalry, and the other to the overall military commander in Manchester, Lieutenant Colonel Guy L'Estrange. The contents of both notes were similar: Sir, as chairman of the select committee of magistrates, I request you to proceed immediately to no. 6 Mount Street, where the magistrates are assembled. They consider the Civil Power wholly inadequate to preserve the peace. I have the honour, & c. Wm. Hulton. The notes were handed to two horsemen who were standing by. The Manchester and Salford Yeomanry were stationed just a short distance away in Portland Street, and so received their note first. They immediately drew their swords and galloped towards St Peter's Field. One trooper, in a frantic attempt to catch up, knocked down a woman in Cooper Street, causing the death of her son when he was thrown from her arms; two-year-old William Fildes was the first casualty of Peterloo.Sixty cavalrymen of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry, led by Captain Hugh Hornby Birley, a local factory owner, arrived at the house from where the magistrates were watching; some reports allege that they were drunk. Andrews, the Chief Constable, instructed Birley that he had an arrest warrant which he needed assistance to execute. Birley was asked to take his cavalry to the hustings to allow the speakers to be removed; it was by then about 1:40 pm. The route towards the hustings between the special constables was...\n++++++++\nAnswer:"}], "response": "William"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Q: positive (OPTIONS:\n- negative\n- positive)\nA: If its you and me right now if its you and me forever thatd be alright \nQ: negative (OPTIONS:\n- negative\n- positive)\nA: ....back to cold, hard reality after a weekend away camping \nQ: negative (OPTIONS:\n- negative\n- positive)\nA:"}], "response": "@alliecobra nooo not a snow day... too cold"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Consider the question.

Anyone born with any type of disfigurement would have their fate automatically led in the direction of becoming a slave to their masters named \"Igors\", and are typecast as being foolish, slurring, and stupid.However, one particular Igor (John Cusack), tired of the mistreatment and stereotyping against him, is actually scientifically intelligent, despite being shunned by his own master, Dr. Glickenstein (John Cleese). Behind his master's back, he has brought a sarcastic rabbit named Scamper (Steve Buscemi) back to life from having been run over and making him immortal. He also transports a brain that formerly belonged to a man named Brian into a life-support robot, named Brain (Sean Hayes).Dr. Glickenstein invents a rocket as his entry into the annual Evil Scientists Fair, but he is killed during a malfunctioning test run. Knowing his chance at becoming more than what the world sees in him, Igor decides to keep his master's death a secret and participate in the Fair himself. He assembles a huge, monstrous being from human tissue and places the Evil Bone -- the key to pure evil -- inside the finger of this monster. Only, when he brings her to life, he discovers the giant is completely gentle, polite and affectionate. When explaining how she's supposed to act, the giant (Molly Shannon) mispronounces the word \"evil\" and converts it to \"Eva\", which becomes her name.Igor surmises that the Evil Bone had not activated properly, and immediately brings Eva to the \"Brain-Wash\" to correct this by making her watch violent acts of horror on television. Brain absentmindedly changes the...\n----\nAnswer: Scamper and Brain\n\n\nQuestion: What army defeats Kalinga? If there is no answer, please output \"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\". Movie title: Asoka Context: The movie begins with an opening crawl, giving the viewer some context. Asoka is a child when his grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya, decides to renounce the throne to become a Jainist monk. Before his departure, Asoka's grandfather finds out that Asoka stole his sword and he confronts him. Chandragupta tells Asoka that his sword is cursed to taste blood whenever it is drawn, and he throws it into a creek. After he leaves, Asoka finds the sword and keeps it. The throne goes to Asoka's father, Bindusara, and the movie skips to Asokas adulthood. Bindusara is about to renounce the throne to his successor. He names his son Susima, who has the support of all his brothers except Asoka. When the movie picks up, Asoka is leading his troops in battle against the Takshila army, who have an advantage in numbers. Asoka prevails and kills the leader of the Takshilas. He comes home alive and unharmed, which angers Susima. Susima had ordered General Shivrath to make Asoka conquer Takshila with half an army, expecting Asoka to die in the struggle. Susima orders Shivrath dead and hires an assassin to kill Asoka while he is bathing. Asoka kills the assassin with ease and goes to visit his mother. His mother expresses concern and tells Asoka to leave the city, threatening to take a vow of silence if he does not. Not wanting his mother to never speak to anyone again, Asoka reluctantly leaves. Asoka wanders around, going under the name Pawan, and encounters a beautiful woman. He is immediately stricken with love, and he follows her. After hearing a request for the capture of Princess Kaurwaki and Prince Arya of Kalinga, Asoka saves the woman from attackers who wanted to collect the reward.

Lao Li (He Xingquan) is a once-divorced retired police officer, currently living with his second wife Zhang Xiu'e (Guan Jiangge). Lao Li's first wife ran off years ago, forcing him to raise his son, Jianjun alone. Jianjun (Liao Zhong), now a grown man, has recently married Xiaohong (Wang Lan) and works long hours as a taxi driver. A passive man, Jianjun and Xiaohong's marriage is suffering from his long hours and her resentments. She eventually begins an affair and becomes pregnant, though the father remains a mystery. Jianjun announces that the baby will be born when Xiaohong discovers that her condition was actually a false pregnancy, and that she has actually been diagnosed with uterine cancer. Meanwhile, Xiu'e's son from a previous marriage, the delinquent Xiaolei (Xu Tao) has begun to run with local hoodlums, much to the consternation of his mother and stepfather. Lao Li steps in and gets Xiaolei a job on a trolley-car, where he becomes interested in the pretty coworker, Qian Xue (He Qin). Unfortunately Xiaolei seems unable to escape from his life of petty crime. Into this drama, Lao Li receives an unexpected package, his first wife's ashes.

I have no problem with divorce since, as others have stated, everyone has their reasons, however there was one person that I dated briefly but upon hearing the reason why he divorced I opted to end the relationship. I remember, we were having brunch and were talking about our past relationships and what happened. He brought up his marriage. I had previously known his divorce but, up until this point, not the reasoning. He told me, straight out, that he had cheated. Now, cheating in itself is one thing. I try not to judge since everyone has a past and I was never always innocent myself, however his attitude about it was what was very off-putting to me. He didn\u2019t seem remotely fazed by what he was telling me at all. There he was, spreading jelly on his toast as he told me about all the women he had cheated on his wife with. He told me about how it had started with a secretary (talk about cliches!) and then graduated to trysts in motels with girls off Tinder all with the same amount of casualness as someone describing how to make an omelette! And when he finally finished the tale of his cheating adventures I asked him if he regretted cheating on his wife with so many women, His answer? \u201cOh Definitely.\u201d Oh good! So at least he regrets his actions, right? Or he\u2019s at least a little sorry about it> Wrong. \u201cOne of the reasons I regret not divorcing her sooner. Had I divorced her sooner, I wouldn\u2019t have to have cheated on her so much. But it is what it is and, well, I was unhappy.\u201d I have no problems with divorced men. I can forgive a man who has cheated in his past. But a man who had no problems cheating so frivolously and, in all honestly, would likely do it again without problems? Nope, not for me. Question: When were they having brunch? Options: - After his divorce.   - not enough information   - After he met a girl on Tinder.   - After he cheated with his secretary. === The correct answer is\n(A).\nAfter his divorce.\n\n\n(Q).\nI don\u2019t know how this rates as \u201cshocking\u201d, I guess it might depend on the culture in which you live, but, it is at the least \u201crepulsive\u201d or disgusting. There was a huge corporation in which I had a contract with. I was called in, to help them uncover what they considered \u201ca very serious series of incidents\u201d. Their own \u201cin house\u201d attempts were fruitless. It turned out, they had an over-sized engineering department, and that it had been announced that this would be scaled back due to completion of contracts. Someone though, within the engineering department, was sabotaging the continued work, slowing the completion. I was to go undercover, posing as a visiting engineer from a distant plant, and find out who the perpetrator/s were, as they wished to file legal action. So, this is at the corporate headquarters, in the late 1980\u2019s. These people were making 6 figure incomes easily. That being said, you kind of expect a bit more of a dignified behavior here than you would with a construction laborer or dishwasher. I completed my job in four days, giving them the evidence and name of the lone individual respsonsible for the sabotage. What exactly was he doing? He carried rubber gloves in his back pocket, and he would periodically use the restroom, and remove his feces from the toilet and smear it all over the walls, covering as much surface as he could. He would also visit restrooms in different departments and do the same. This would cause the unionized individuals, who only had that restroom to use in their area, to walk off their work stations. Seriously, a butt-hurt guy fearing a layoff, so he decided to smear his shit all over the place before it even happened. He readily confessed when confronted by HR, further destroying his work record/career. Question: What happened when HR confronted the man? Options: - He confessed   - He quit   - not enough information   - He denied it === The correct answer is\n(A).\nHe confessed\n\n\n(Q).\nThat day, my mother picked me up from school, wearing the yellow sundress and shawl I remembered from our trip with Father the year before. She looked just like she did most days back then--a glamour queen, a movie star (\"Just like Lena Horne,\" my friend Chloe had once said, \"only darker--oh, sorry, Leah!\"), but today her beauty somehow had a harder, more defiant edge to it. I could smell the expensive Dior perfume as soon as I opened the door, which surprised me, because my mom was usually fastidious about not getting perfume on her clothes. She was wearing her bug glasses--huge dark things with lenses that bulged out like fly eyes and reflected my face like a fun-house mirror. She had tied a yellow silk scarf around her hair and was taking deep pulls on a cigarette held between two immaculately manicured fingers. Only I knew about the nicotine stains she carefully covered with her special order \"forest sable\" cream each morning. Tiffany, a stupid but vicious senator's daughter who I had the misfortune of sharing a classroom with, suddenly dashed from inside the school, her face flushed. \"Hello, Mrs. Wilson,\" she called. Before my mother could respond, she giggled and ran back to three of her friends waiting beyond the door. I could hear them laughing, but I was glad I couldn't understand their words. They were all fascinated with my mother--the black housekeeper who dressed like Katharine Hepburn and drove a Cadillac, whose daughter's \"light toffee\" skin indicated that she might just like her coffee with a lot of cream. Sometimes I hated those girls. \"Get in the car, Leah,\" my mother said. Her already husky voice was pitched low, as though she'd been crying. That made me nervous. Why was she here? \"Ma, Chloe was going to show me her dad's new camera. Can't I go home on the bus?\" My mom pulled on the cigarette until it burned the filter, and then ground it into the car ashtray--already filled with forty or so butts. She always emptied out the ashtray each evening. Question: What did the mother drive?

With financial help from crooked lawyer Steve Dutton, who himself came from the Tenderloin, she sets herself up in the vice trade, providing women on demand. Jenny has one loyal friend, the Chinese woman Amah, who helps take care of the baby. At a party in Steve's honor, he catches gambler Ed Harris (an uncredited J. Carrol Naish) cheating him in a back room. In the ensuing struggle, Steve kills him, with Jenny the only eyewitness. The pair are unable to dispose of the body before it is found and are questioned by the police. However, neither is charged. The scandal forces Jenny to temporarily give up her baby to a very respectable couple who owe Steve a favor to keep the child from being taken away from her.

It is a special night for noted astronomer Ted Lewis, who is preparing a special anniversary dinner with steaks for his beautiful, adoring wife Lana while observing the annual meteor shower of the Perseids. In another part of town, Tammy, a waitress at small local diner with big plans for the future, looks out her window and is excited to see a shooting star, which she takes as a good sign for her dreams. Suddenly \"something shoots overhead and crashes\" in the nearby mountains. Assuming it is a fallen meteorite, Ted wants to investigate in person. He reaches the supposed meteorite, which turns out to be an alien spaceship. Then his body is usurped by Urp, a well-meaning, tall, and metallic alien. Urp has discovered that the other passenger of his ship, the one-eyed monster known as Ghota has escaped. He needs to retrieve it and uses a human body to blend in with the locals.[2] The Ghota consumes people in order to grow, multiply, and conquer. Its unquenchable appetite could mean the end of life on Earth.[2] Urp is the only one who knows how to stop the hideous extraterrestrial. He enlists the aid of Tammy, the only human in town willing to believe and trust in his mission. The local police - including Chief Dawson and Officer Vern - are confirmed skeptics and offer little help. Together, Urp and Tammy must hunt down the Ghota and neutralize it before it consumes all the local inhabitants and uses the human fuel to multiply and conquer the world. Urp and Tammy eventually fall in love. But at the finale, he is compelled to return to his home in space and she is left longing for his company. While she remains on Earth, she finally leaves the small town to go in search of her own destiny. [3]\nA: Lana\n\nQ: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Runaway Train Movie plot: The story follows the escape of two men from an Alaska prison, the efforts of a train dispatching office to safely stop the out-of-control train they are on, and the hunt by their warden to recapture them.Oscar \"Manny\" Manheim (Jon Voight) is a ruthless bank robber and hero to the convicts of Stonehaven Maximum Security Prison. After two previous escape attempts the doors to Manny's cell have been welded shut for three years. A court order compels Manny's nemesis, the vindictive Associate Warden Ranken (John P. Ryan), to release him back into the general prison population. Manny immediately sets his next escape plan into action.Buck (Eric Roberts) is another convict (convicted of statutory rape) who, due to his position in the prison's laundry room, is recruited to smuggle Manny out in a laundry trolley. Naive and unintelligent, Buck decides to escape with Manny, who doesn't care for company. After a freezing cross-country hike (involving a 300 ft drop into a river and subsequent swim) the two hop on board a train consisting of four locomotives at a remote Alaskan rail yard.Just as the train is set in motion, the elderly engineer suffers a heart attack. In attempting to stop the train and get off, the engineer does not close the throttle, instead pulling on the conductor's emergency brake lever, before collapsing off the still-moving train. Consequently, although the brakes apply, the locomotives overpower them, and the brake shoes burn off, making it now impossible to stop the train.Neither the two convicts nor the only railway worker left on the train, a locomotive hostler named Sara (Rebecca De Mornay), are aware of their situation (the convicts due to taking refuge inside the fourth car's toilet compartment, Sara due to being asleep in the second car).As the train accelerates, dispatcher Frank Barstow (Kyle T.

Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (May 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Major Charles 'Copper' Carrington (David Niven), who has a distinguished World War II record and was awarded the Victoria Cross, is arrested for embezzling \u00c2\u00a3125 from his unit's safe. Other charges include leaving the base and entertaining a woman officer in his room, this being forbidden by the base commander Colonel Henniker (Allan Cuthbertson). Appearing in his own defence, Carrington's case at his court-martial is that he took the money openly because of back pay owed him. The Army Paymaster had failed to pay him for expenses during postings in the Far East and his wife Valerie (Margaret Leighton) was pressuring him for money. She lives in another part of the country, and has become ill and suicidal as a result of financial worries. Carrington claims he told his superior, Colonel Henniker, about his decision to remove the money. He transferred \u00c2\u00a3100 of it to his wife's account to give her relief from her financial problems. He then left the base to compete in a major horse race in which he betted the rest of the money on himself, hoping to be able to pay back the cash taken. When he fell from his horse, his friend Captain Alison Graham (Noelle Middleton) tried to return the money, but was denied access to the safe. As for the incident in his room, it is established that Carrington was bed-ridden from his fall and that Graham was visiting him to discuss the embezzlement. She was fully dressed and sitting on a chair when Colonel Henniker stormed in, reminding them that it was against regulations for male and female officers to be together in private quarters. Henniker admits waiting for some time between seeing Graham go to Carrington's room and then entering himself. Henniker is in fact Carrington's enemy, resenting his war record, achievements and popularity at the base.

He borrows Mr. Clay's pickup and transports the harvest to their store, carrying ten bags per trip, prepared for sale. If the onions are in 50 kgs bags, and the pickup makes 20 trips, what's the total weight of onions harvested by Titan's father?\nReasoning and answer: The total revenue from the adults is 183 x $26 = $4758.

And now new research shows parents are turning to their children for lessons in technology. The new study of around 1,000 parents showed that 67% of parents have asked their teenager children for technology-related advice. 44% have asked their teenager for help using the Internet, and 41% have received teen advice about how to use the TV or home entertainment system. Ahad Surooprajally, a father of five children, says his children help him with technology in the home. \"They've grown up surrounded by technology,\" he explains. \"We have four computers and four iPads in our house. If I want to know something technical they're the ones I go to.\" He says his nine-year-old son Habeeb is the only person in the house who really understands the TV. So he tells Habeeb which film he wants to watch and Habeeb connects his mobile phone to the TV. \"You teach your kids everyday life lessons, but the tables are turned when it comes to technology,\" says Ahad. As well as learning how to use technology properly, there is another advantage of parents asking their children to help them understand the  digital world. They may be able to get a better understanding of what their kids are doing online. Will Gardner of the charity Childnet International says, \"We have to continuously encourage parents to find out more about what their children are doing online. If the kids are using a social networking site, get them to show you around it if you are not using it already.\" Question: What do we know about the new study? - Few parents trust their children to give them advice. - About half of the parents have no idea how to use a computer. - Most teenagers know more about the Internet than their parents. - Over two-thirds of parents turned to their teenagers on tech matters.\n**Answer**\nOver two-thirds of parents turned to their teenagers on tech matters.\n\n*Question*\nRead the following article and select the best answer.

Article: Robert Frost was at heart a mean-spirited human being, not the kind of man one would expect to write poetry. He was born in San Francisco. Frost entered Dartmouth University in 1893, but dropped out, and switched to Harvard, which he attended for two years. He started a brief teaching career, where he was inspired to become a poet by some of his students' work. Frost stopped teaching and became a farmer. During this time he wrote numerous poems, and a couple of short stories. While he was a farmer he started to think seriously about becoming a famous poet. In almost all of his poems, Frost wrote in the first person. The first widely-read poem that he published was called My Butterfly. At first his audience was very small, but with his Collected Poems he became famous. Robert Frost received almost all the awards that there were for poetry. His poetry describes the forces of nature, and the violence and deep emotional  needs of human beings, which reflect the experiences of his childhood. Robert Frost will always be known as one of the best poets in history. His way of putting emotion and violence into words is remarkable . His talent for poetry is natural-born and he had discovered this when he started to farm. Even though he treated his wife and children terribly, he still became one of the best-known poets of his and our day. Question: From the passage we know that   _  . - Robert Frost's most famous poem is My Butterfly - Robert Frost began to write when he was in college - Robert Frost gave up studying at Dartmouth University - his poetry showed the violence of war and his childhood\n**Answer**\nRobert Frost gave up studying at Dartmouth University\n\n*Question*\nRead the following article and select the best answer. Article: Targeting teens Using the Web makes teens a target. Posting too much personal information for those millions of cyber eyes to see can cause some big problems and can even invite a threat to your life. As Mary learned, not everyone on the Internet is who he or she says they are. Adults will sometimes pose as other teens, posting fake photos and nice messages to gain trust. They use their fake identity to access the personal information of others, such as home address, phone number, or school name. \"That's not the most common scenario \", says David Finkelhor, a sociology professor at the University of New Hampshire. \"Only 3 percent of teens aged 10 to 18 who use the Internet report being asked to meet offline.

In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot. Democrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country. In New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president. \"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration. At a news conference Wednesday, Northam said his victory showed that Virginians had a message for the country and the world. \"The divisiveness, the hatred, the bigotry, the politics that is tearing this country apart, that is not the United States of America that people love and it certainly not the Commonwealth of Virginia that they love,\" he said. Political analysts said Democratic enthusiasm and a focus on Trump were clearly on display in both states. \"We have heard for months and months about all this energy on the left. It had not materialized until tonight,\" said Steve Peoples of the Associated Press. \"A big night for Democrats and, really, it was a repudiation of sorts of the Trump nationalist message.\" Even some Republicans saw the results as a rejection of the Trump political brand.

The case would go cold in a hurry. Carnie was ready to check out of her room--not because of any fear of getting caught--just from boredom. She hadn't sold the old lady's jewelry, but had plenty of cash anyway. Carnie flipped open her cell phone and dialed. \"Hello?\" \"Hey, Sis, how are you doing?\" \"Fine. What's going on?\" \"How about if I come stay with you guys for a few days before the wedding?\" \"You mean now?\" \"Yeah. If you don't mind.\" \"Uh...sure, that'll be fine.\" \"Great. It'll be like old times.\" \"No, no. I can't party all night and get drunk.\" Carsie laughed. \"Okay. Maybe not exactly like old times. But we'll have fun. See you in thirty minutes.\" \"Thirty minutes? Where are you?\" But Carnie had already hung up. It was hard to believe that her sister, Carsie, had wormed her way into the heart of the wealthy doctor. Sis had a lot more patience than she did. She would have just slit his throat and skipped town with his fortune. Surely Carsie hadn't actually fallen in love with the nerd. Maybe her biological clock had started ticking too loud to ignore. Carsie was about to turn 31, and Carnie was only a year behind her. But unlike her sister, Carnie didn't need a man to support her and give her babies. Anything she needed she would get for herself, thank you very much. But it would be hysterical to watch Carsie go through the whole 'until death do we part' shtick.

We will keep open lines of communication.\"  But notably, Mattis did not indicate the Trump administration would seek congressional approval before the strike, which presumably would target the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Trump says the U.S. will soon launch \"nice and new and smart\" missiles in response to last week's suspected poison gas attack, which left scores dead in a rebel-held area. Trump blames Assad for the attack.  A U.S. attack is likely to upset a small but growing number of U.S. lawmakers who demand President Donald Trump first ask Congress to authorize any hostilities, citing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, a federal law intended to check the president's ability to wage war. U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have long argued they have legal authority to order airstrikes and other short-term military campaigns if those engagements fall short of the \"hostilities\" mentioned in the War Powers Resolution.  Additionally, U.S. presidents have cited a pair of authorizations by Congress following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks as justification for the near-constant U.S. strikes on Islamic militants around the world.  The Trump administration has used those authorizations as justification for its current war in Syria. The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, and helps lead an international coalition against Islamic State in Syria and neighboring Iraq.  The overwhelming majority of U.S. lawmakers have not publicly objected to the administration's legal rationale for those missions.

It is the longest race in the world. To make the runner's body work, harder training is quite necessary. A runner should start to prepare for a marathon at least three months before. Preparation may have races, many hours of running at different speeds and changes in diet . During the training time the runner must eat a fit diet.  The diet should have lots of things needed in training the players. In the early days of training, runners run 80km per week. The running is increased every two or three weeks and at least two long runs per week are needed. Two weeks before the marathon, the training programme becomes less, from 100km per week down to 60km and then to 30km in the final week. On the last two days they may not run at all. Breakfast should be eaten at least three hours before the race.  Easily digested  food such as cereal , toast  and scrambled  egg is best,  with as much fluid  as possible.  Runners should drink water about half an hour before the race to keep up the body fluid. Players must have   _   in order to run better in a marathon. A) training at different speeds and changes in diet B) much water C) lessons before the race D) many fruits\n(Answer)\nA\n\n\nQues: I am a mother of two children. Like many other parents, I worry  that my children watch too much TV. Why? First, there are lots of bad programmes   on TV. They may learn from them. Second, watching too much TV is bad for their eyes. Many students wear glasses because they watch TV for long hours. Third, watching too much TV makes children think little . I think it is very important for children to read some books. Reading books makes children think more. When I tell this to my children, they just don't listen to me.

Children born under Aquarius may be less clever than those born in other seasons. They may also have shorter lives than those born in autumn  Scientists believe many of the differences can be explained by the mother's exposure to sunlight in pregnancy .  Sunlight helps lead to the production of Vitamin D in the body. The lack of this in the first months of life may have a bad effect on mental and physical health. Vitamin D, called the \"sunshine vitamin\", is known to help regulate  thousands of genes during development, according to a study of more than two million people. So Vitamin D has a good effect on health  This study showed that people born from April to June had slightly shorter lives than those born in October, November or December. Similar studies in the USA showed that people born in autumn lived about 160 days longer than those born in spring. Professor Russell Foster, an Oxford University neuroscientist on seasonal biology, said the conclusions were surprising and interesting. He added, \"These are small effects but they are very, very clear. I am not giving voice to star signs and they are just for fun. But it is true that we are affected by our season of birth.\" Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? A) People born in spring may not be in good health. B) Children born under Aquarius are cleverer than those born under Libra. C) Professor Russell Foster is interested in star signs and believes in them D) People born in May will live longer than those born in October.\n(A).\nA\n\n\nQues:The greatest saleswoman in the world today doesn't mind if you call her a girl. That's because Markita Andrews has got more than eight thousand dollars selling Girl Scout cookies since she was seven years old. Going door-to-door after school, the terribly shy Markita changed herself into the cookie-selling dynamo . It starts with great wish. For Markita and her mother, whose husband left them when Markita was eight years old, their dream was to travel the world. \"I'll work hard to make enough money to send you to college,\" her mother said one day. \"When you leave college, you'll make enough money to take you and me around the world. Okay?\" So at the age of 13 when Markita read in her Girl Scout magazine that the Scout who sold the most cookies would win a free trip for two around the world, she decided to sell all the Girl Scout cookies she could--more Girl Scout cookies than anyone in the world, ever. Wish, however, alone is not enough. To make her dream come true, Markita knew she needed a plan. \"When you are doing business, wear your Girl Scout clothes when you go up to people in their building, \" her aunt told her. \"Always smile, whether they buy something or not and always be nice.\" Lots of other Scouts may have wanted that trip around the world, but only Markita went off in her own uniform each day after school, ready to ask--and keep asking--people to help in her dream. Markita sold 3,526 boxes of Girl Scout cookies that year and won her trip around the world. Since then, she has sold more than 42,000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies. Markita is no cleverer than thousands of other people, with dreams of their own. The difference is that many people fail before they even begin. They fear that they will be refused. This fear leads many of us to refuse ourselves and prevents us from getting where we have set off for long before anyone else ever has the chance--no matter what we are selling. \"It takes courage to ask for what you want,\" she said. \"Courage is not that you don't have fear. It means doing what it... The main reason for Markita's success is that   _  . A) she asks for what she wants before she is refused B) she isn't afraid to be refused C) her aunt has told her how to sell things D) she has a good wish\n\nAns:B\n\n\nThis is a photo of Ben's family.

Movie title: Once Upon a Time in America Context: The film is presented in non-chronological order, from the 1920s to the 1960s, and it is largely told through flashbacks from the viewpoint of one person. The specific scenes and their order varies from version to version. The following section describes the full European cut of the film. The film begins in medias res with gangsters entering a Chinese puppet theater, looking for a marked man. The proprietors slip into a hidden opium den and warn a man named \"Noodles\", but he pays no attention. In a flashback, he watches the police remove three disfigured corpses from a street. He successfully kills one of the three thugs that are after him but learns that the thugs have murdered his girlfriend while looking for him and finds that someone else has stolen his money. He leaves the city. David \"Noodles\" Aaronson struggles as a street kid in the Jewish ghetto on the Lower East Side of Manhattan,[3] in 1920. He and his friends Patrick \"Patsy\" Goldberg, Phillip \"Cockeye\" Stein, and little Dominic commit petty crimes under the supervision of the local boss Bugsy. Planning to rob a drunk at the moment a passing truck hides them from a policeman, they're foiled by the older Max Bercovicz, who jumps off of the truck to rob the man himself. Noodles confronts Max but a crooked policeman steals the watch they were fighting over. By chance, they later find him with a teenage girl; Max's camera enables them to blackmail him and start their own gang independent of Bugsy. The boys establish a suitcase money fund, which they hide in a locker at a train station, giving the key to Fat Moe, a reliable friend who's not part of the operation. Noodles is in love with Fat Moe's sister Deborah, who aspires to be a dancer and actress. One day, Bugsy ambushes the boys and shots Dominic, who dies in Noodles' arms. An enraged Noodles stabs Bugsy to death and also stabs a police officer who tried to intervene, but is knocked unconscious by another officer and arrested. He is sentenced to 12 years in prison. An adult Noodles is released from...\nAnswer: a retirement home\n\nQuestion: Question: What planet was Parallax imprisoned on?

Movie title: Green Lantern Context: Billions of years ago, beings called the Guardians of the Universe used the green essence of willpower to create an intergalactic police force called the Green Lantern Corps. They divided the universe into 3600 sectors, with one Green Lantern per sector. One such Green Lantern, Abin Sur of Sector 2814, defeated the malevolent being Parallax and imprisoned him in the Lost Sector on the desolate planet Ryut. In the present day, Parallax escapes from his prison after becoming strengthened by an encounter with crash survivors on the planet, feeding off of their fear to gain strength before pursuing and nearly killing Abin Sur, who escapes and crash-lands on Earth where he commands his power ring to find a worthy successor. Hal Jordan, a cocky test pilot working at Ferris Aircraft, is chosen by the ring and transported to the crash site, where the dying Abin Sur appoints him a Green Lantern, telling him to take the lantern and speak the oath. At home he says the oath and is later whisked away to the Green Lantern Corps home planet of Oa, where he meets and trains with veteran Corps members Tomar-Re and Kilowog and Corps leader Sinestro, who believes he is unfit and fearful. Jordan quits and returns to Earth, keeping the power ring and lantern. Meanwhile, scientist Hector Hammond is summoned by his strikingly attractive, muscular[3] father, Senator Robert Hammond, to a secret government facility to perform an autopsy on Abin Sur's body, under the watchful eye of Amanda Waller. A piece of Parallax inside the corpse enters Hammond, giving him telepathic and telekinetic powers, at the cost of his sanity. After discovering that he was chosen for the secret work only due to his father's influence, Hammond attempts to kill his father by telekinetically sabotaging his helicopter at a party. Jordan saves the senator and the party guests, including his childhood sweetheart Carol Ferris.

Movie title: Blazing Saddles Context: In the American Old West of 1874, construction on a new railroad will soon be going through Rock Ridge, a frontier town inhabited exclusively by white people with the surname Johnson. The conniving State Attorney General Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) wants to force Rock Ridge's residents to abandon their town, thereby lowering land prices. After he sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky assistant Taggart (Slim Pickens), to shoot the sheriff and harass the townspeople, the townspeople demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane (Mel Brooks) appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart (Cleavon Little), a black railroad worker who was about to be hanged. A black sheriff, he reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos, and leave the town at his mercy. With his quick wits and the assistance of recovering alcoholic gunslinger Jim, the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder), Bart works to overcome the townspeople's hostile reception. He subdues and befriends Mongo (Alex Karras), an immensely strong, slow-thinking, but surprisingly philosophical henchman sent to kill him, and then beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtupp (Madeline Kahn) at her own game. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, hatches a larger plan involving a recruited army of thugs, including common criminals, Ku Klux Klansmen, and Nazi soldiers. Three miles east of Rock Ridge, Bart gathers the townspeople and the black and Chinese railroad workers\u00e2\u0080\u0094who have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the community\u00e2\u0080\u0094to build a fake town as a diversion. They labor all night to build a perfect replica of their town; but with no people in it, Bart realizes it won't fool Lamarr's villains. While the townspeople construct replicas of themselves, Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the \"William J.

Shelves were full of \"specials\" that had not yet been looted and based on the number of blue shirts I saw, I knew service would be easily found.  I came in because this was the nearest store to my home that offered the SiriusXM radio kit with car adapter for $29.  Having been a previous subscriber, this looked like a good deal and my past radio was idiot-proof installation.  I found the kiosk and begin looking at the options.  There were 3 or 4 different choices, all varying steps up from the $29 version.  After about 30 seconds I am greeted by two employees.  One girl, one guy (Sean).  I pick up a radio and ask \"is this a complete kit? plug and play plus a radio?\"  The girl responds \"Uhmm... I think so\" and Sean, god bless him \"No, its just a box\".  Ok f#$%3er... comedy hour, huh??  So I ignore him, trying to ignore both of them and keep looking.  The girl volunteers what little (and clearly wrong) knowledge she has and I just kinda give her a head nod like 'i got this' and say \"thanks\".  They take the hint and both walk away.  Sean, my new found friend in skinny pants loudly says \"You're Welcome!\" as he walks away with his back to me.  Congratulations, Sir... you just earned a phone call to Corporate.  No less than a minute later a kid comes up in a geek squad shirt. I can see the other two being seasonal hires but HE SHOULD KNOW SOMETHING!!

His response: \"No, you have to pull the radio and install from the rear. It is kind of complicated, we offer it for $79\".    In spite of the Best Buy employees, I bought the sale item I came in for, walk to my car, and no less than 5 minutes later, IN THE PARKING LOT, I am listening to SiriusXM.  No $79 install, just 3 wires.  Idiot-proof!   They need to make the instructions a little clearer on the box so they can take it to the next level down... Best Buy Employee-proof.

The setup is nice, a delightful--if a bit sterile--reproduction of what you'd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough TV.  The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and it's an OK atmosphere to see a show and laugh.  It's too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy.  Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh--Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, Second City--all perform elsewhere (though they managed to get Bob Saget, to their credit).  But the biggest problem is the food and drink.  They're very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show.  The prices are well above what I'd consider reasonable given the quality, and I'd begrudgingly--or even happily--just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad.  You're forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn't want in the first place.  I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I'd rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.  Still, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians.  Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements.  A few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed: 1 - A lot of the drinks didn't have prices on them.  I know this isn't uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it's an incredibly poor decision here.  Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear.  It's not that hard. 2 - Put the drink prices on the website too.  An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said \"Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!\"  I'm calling shenanigans.  Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning. 3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you're trying to trick me.  It's kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one's customers. 4 - Since the $3.50 soft drinks don't come with free refills, the servers shouldn't ask \"would you like a refill on that?\" or anything of the sort.  They should ask \"would you like another one?\" instead.  They should also respond to requests for refills by saying \"we don't offer refills, but I'd be happy to get you another one.\"  Just because there's a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn't mean people all figure it out.  Most patrons don't even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Problem:\n\nDo you think the right answer to the question \"mitosis begins when what unite in fertilization? \" is \"gonads\", given that  gametes then unite in fertilization and begin Mitosis?\n****\nA: No\n\n\nProblem:\n\nDo you think the right answer to the question \"what must be overcome when pushing on bike pedals?\" is \"pollution\", given that  pushing on bike pedals cause the bike to overcome inertia?\n****\nA: No\n\n\nProblem:\n\nDo you think the right answer to the question \"what do roots turn into?\" is \"bushes\", given that  roots turn into branches?\n****\nA: No\n\n\nProblem:\n\nDo you think the right answer to the question \"how does the phylum Nematoda reproduce?\" is \"allow growth\", given that  the phylum Nematoda reproduces sexually?\n****\nA:"}], "response": "No"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Translate \"(o) United Nations/International Astronautical Federation Workshop on Education and Capacity-Building in Space Technology for the Benefit of Developing Countries, with emphasis on remote sensing, held in Bremen, Germany;\" to French?\n"}], "response": "o) Atelier Organisation des Nations Unies / F\u00e9d\u00e9ration internationale d'astronautique sur l'\u00e9ducation et le renforcement des capacit\u00e9s dans le domaine de techniques spatiales au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des pays en d\u00e9veloppement, en particulier la t\u00e9l\u00e9d\u00e9tection, tenu \u00e0 Br\u00eame (Allemagne);"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is this product review positive?

Researchers from Pennsylvania State University and Duke University tracked more than 700 children from across the US between kindergarten and age 25 and found a significant correlation between their social skills as kindergartners and their success as adults two decades later. In 1991, teachers assessed how the kindergartners interacted  with each other socially using a range of criteria like whether they cooperate with their peers without prompting , if they're helpful to others, whether they're good at understanding feelings, and if they can solve problems on their own. Researchers then kept track of whether the students went on to graduate high school on time, get a college degree, and find and keep a full-time job by 25. They also monitored the participants' involvement with crime, drug abuse, public assistance, and mental health issues. The results showed that socially competent children were far more likely to earn a college degree and have a full-time job by 25 than those with limited social skills. Those with limited social skills also had a higher chance of getting arrested, binge drinking, and applying for public housing. \"This study shows that helping children develop social and emotional skills is one of the most important things we can do to prepare them for a healthy future,\" said Kristin Schubert, program director at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which funded the research, in a release. \"From an early age, these skills can determine whether a child goes to college or prison, and whether they end up employed or addicted.\" The good news, according to Damon Jones, lead author of the study, is that intervention at a young age can help improve social and emotional skills. \"This research by itself doesn't prove that higher social competence can lead to better outcomes later on,\" he said. \"But when combined with other research, it is clear that...\n++++++++\nAnswer: Question: What should parents do to help their children to succeed according to Kristin Schubert?Options:A Teach them how to cooperate with others.B Teach them some basic living skills.C Tell them to keep off alcoholD Coach them in their lessons.Answer:A\n\n\nPlease answer this: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Digital technology -- email and smart phones especially -- have vastly improved workers' ability to be productive outside of a traditional office. Even so, most white-collar work still happens in an office. One reason is that, according to findings of a new survey   of office workers conducted by Wakefield Research for the IT company Citrix, most bosses are doubtful about remote working. Half of the workers say their boss doesn't accept it and only 35 percent say it's tolerated. Skeptical bosses will likely have their doubts reinforced   by the same survey, which shows that 43 percent of workers say they've watched TV or a movie while \"working\" remotely, while 35 percent have done housework,and 28 percent have cooked dinner. It is true, however,that working at home makes people much more efficient  , because it allows workers to take care of annoying housework while still getting their jobs done. It's much faster, for example, to shop for groceries at a quarter to three than to stand in line during the after-work rush. The fact that such practices remain officially unaccepted reflects how far we haven't come as a society from the days when we expected every full-time worker to be supported by a full-time homemaker. More broadly the Wakefield survey suggests that employers may be missing a low-cost way to give workers something of value. Sixty-four percent of those survey participants who have worked remotely would rather give up some bonus in order to get even one day a week working from home. Under such circumstances, smart firms need to find ways to let their employees have enough flexibility to manage their time efficiently.\n++++++++\nAnswer: Question: What seems to be most workers' attitude toward remote working?Options:A Doubtful.B Favorable.C Reserved.D Disapproving.Answer:B\n\n\nPlease answer this: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: If you have been pulled over by the police, then you would have got a traffic ticket because of breaking some law. In some states, you can reduce the mistakes on your driving record by choosing to attend a traffic school. Here is what to expect if you make up your mind to start taking the traffic school classes.          People who break certain rules when driving such as speeding, running red lights, or causing an accident will receive a ticket. The ticket comes with many consequences to force you to  _ the law. The consequences include a certain increase to the money you pay to the insurance company. For example, a traffic ticket will increase your charge by about 15%.          Many states have a regulation that attending a traffic school can eliminate a bad record from your driving records. Different states have different methods. Many have a wide variety of ways that allow you to attend the classes in the most convenient way. You do not have to attend classes physically, as you can take courses online or watch a DVD.          Many schools will give the basic level, middle level and advanced level courses for a driver. Others are about alcohol and traffic awareness. The courses lasts 4- 12 hours. The subjects being covered will determine the length of the course.          The main aim of the traffic classes is not about punishing you for the mistakes you have made in driving.

Shot with a transparent low budget, it's an excruciatingly amateur production: bad lighting, listless performances, crude cinematography and creatively bankrupt screenwriting are just the tips of the iceberg. Neither Green nor Culkin seems particularly involved in their role, with each actor's strange cadence and emotionless delivery giving the constant impression that a cash-strapped director used first takes for every shot. Without a single likeable character to its name, Party Monster chooses to embrace and celebrate a lifestyle so waspy, entitled and superficial that I caught myself actively rooting against the lot of them.

After moving into his own apartment, Cal goes to a bar night after night, talking loudly about his divorce, until he attracts the attention of a young man named Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling), a womanizer who beds women each night, although a young woman named Hannah (Emma Stone) recently had rejected his advances.

After this encounter, Cal manages to successfully seduce other women in the bar. He sees Emily again at their son Robbie's (Jonah Bobo) parent-teacher conference.

Title: Transmorphers Movie plot: In 2009, a race of aliens piloting giant robots have conquered Earth and forced humanity to live underground. They have done this by altering the environment, causing constant rainfall and darkness. Over 300 years later, after many generations of living underground, a small group of human rebels plan to finally take back their world from the mechanical invaders. They soon learn however that the aliens do not pilot the robots, but are the robots. A patrol, led by Lt. Blackthorn (Thomas Downey), is sent out to capture one of the robots, a Z-bot, so its operating ability can be studied. The patrol is suddenly ambushed by several robots, with some being able to reconfigure themselves, revealing different weapon systems. These units, the 'transmorphers', ambush humans by appearing as mundane features of the terrain, even fooling detection systems. The robots use \"brain scans\" to read the minds of humans to know their battle plans. After Blackthorn's patrol is destroyed by the machines, a female lead officer of the human resistance group, General Van Ryberg (Eliza Swenson), argues with fellow officers of the Military and Science Guilds about how to fight the war. Despite some protests, Van Ryberg decides to reinstate a disgraced soldier named Warren Mitchell (Matthew Wolf), who was court-martialed along with his right-hand man, Itchy (Griff Furst), and cryogenically frozen for insubordination. They had killed their unit officer five years earlier. Mitchell is glad to be reinstated, but learns that his former lover, Karina Nadir (Amy Weber), a fighter pilot, is now married to General Van Ryberg. Mitchell assembles a small military patrol with Itchy as his second-in-command, and Flight Commander Xandria Lux (Shaley Scott), as his military adviser.

Of Human Feelings received considerable acclaim from contemporary critics. Reviewing the album for Esquire, Gary Giddins hailed it as another landmark recording from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics, partly because of compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless. In his opinion, the discordant keys radically transmute conventional polyphony and may be the most challenging part for listeners, who he said should concentrate on Coleman's playing and \"let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center\". Giddins also highlighted the melody of \"Sleep Talk\", deeming it among the best of the saxophonist's career. Kofi Natambu from the Detroit Metro Times wrote that Coleman's synergetic approach displays expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record \"a multi-tonal mosaic of great power, humor, color, wit, sensuality, compassion and tenderness\". He found the songs inspirational, danceable, and encompassing developments in African-American music over the previous century. Robert Christgau called its \"warm, listenable harmolodic funk\" an artistic \"breakthrough if not a miracle\". He found its exchange of rhythms and simple melodies heartfelt and sophisticated, writing in The Village Voice, \"the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian.\"Purist critics in jazz complained about the music's incorporation of danceable beats and electric guitar. In Stereo Review, Chris Albertson deemed the combination of saxophone and bizarre funk occasionally captivating but ultimately unfocused. Dan Sullivan of the Los Angeles Times believed the album's supporters in \"hip rock circles\" had overlooked flaws, arguing that Tacuma and Coleman's playing sound like a unique \"beacon of clarity\" amid an incessant background. Leonard Feather wrote in the Toledo Blade that the music is stylistically ambiguous, potentially controversial, and difficult to assess but...\nA: Gary\nQuestion: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the band who, along with the co-producers, won the 1978 Grammy Award for Album of the Year? , can you please find it?

Most modern textbooks are arranged so that they tell you what they will teach you (vocabulary and concepts list for the chapter), they teach you (lesson), and then they tell you what they taught you (review). Spanish for Mastery 1 is not arranged in this way. It is very difficult to find vocabulary and concepts in this book by scanning the beginning and end of the chapters. Irregular verbs are presented before regular verbs and, for someone completely new to Spanish, this is a very difficult way to learn.

Bloom's songs are just plain stupid; \"Make Rock Not War\" and \"Beat Em' Up\" (can we say conflicting philosophies) are the worst songs in the band's history,at least up to this point. Lanier is absent from the festivities and reportedly doesn't even consider this a BOC album and refuses to perform any of this live (lucky for us).

This game made me jump more than RE 4 and Manhunt 1. Creepy music, dark backrounds, and a detailed storyline made for a really impressive game. I loved the save points and the subtle clues to help you out because there was not a map to guide you. A unique combat system made this game more unique then other horror games that I have played. There was SOME repetitiveness and frustration, but it was satisfying once you got past those points. I really liked the level designs in this game. The mixture of solving crimes & fighting off bad guys kept me interested from beginning to end. You will feel like a CSI agent. If you have a little patience and like horror, you will love this game.

Her comments were criticised by a Labour AM. Alun Davies said threatening legal action \"sounds like the last breath before you're thrown out of the pub\". Mr Davies said he was not convinced the Welsh Government would \"have a leg to stand on\" in trying to shape international trade deals after Brexit. Following Donald Trump's comments during last week's trade visit that the NHS would be \"on the table\" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was \"absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation.\" The US President then rowed back on his initial comments following criticism from a number of MPs. Asked about her response to President Trump's remarks as she gave evidence to the Assembly's Brexit committee on Monday, Ms Morgan said \"legally, it would be difficult for us to stop because we don't have a veto over trade\". \"Politically, I think it's extremely unlikely to happen,\" the international relations and the Welsh language minister said. \"They [the UK Government] should not be concluding any trade agreements without consulting us where we have the power.\" Ms Morgan explained that UK and Welsh government officials are working on an agreement or 'concordat' for how future trade deals are negotiated. During a robust exchange, the Labour AM Alun Davies said: \"I want something which is in law to which I can hold you to account and which colleagues in Westminster can hold the UK Government to account. \"The argument we'll make life difficult for them, it sounds alright on the street, but it's not the reality of intergovernmental relations.\" \"The United Kingdom has to find a way of functioning. \"At the moment, your answers aren't giving me any confidence that there is that structure in place because, if the Welsh Government's argument is, 'we'll see you in court', it's not a very impressive argument either for the continuation of the structure of United Kingdom as a state or the commitment of the government within the United Kingdom to actually work together,\" he added.

Interestingly, she chooses a woman protagonist that isn't your typical hero. Instead, she is a poverty-stricken older woman, subject to the many dangers of the town she lives in. She has been committed to an institution by a pimp who wants her out of the way so he can take advantage of her niece. In the clinic, she sees a vision that appears very real to her, and claims to be from the future. It tells her that she must stay alive despite the circumstances, because she is important. Readers, along with the woman, Connie, are left wondering if her seemingly meaningless life is actually quite pertinent, or if she is simply too far gone to turn back. As my title says, it lacks depth. There is not much explanation as far as time-travel, theories, and whatnot. I'm not sure that's too important, but for me it left a lot of small holes in the story.

Soon astronauts on the International Space Station could get the chance to try . The expandable habitat made by Bigelow Aerospace recently passed NASA's strict certification requirements and is scheduled to be flown to the station in September. Called the BEAM ( Bigelow Expandable Activity Module), the habitat would be attached to the space station, where it would stay for two years. While there, it would be tested to see how it handles  the _ of space - the radiation, the station's movement and even how it stands up to the debris   flying around in orbit. The private Las Vegas company, founded by millionaire real estate mogul  Robert Bigelow, won a $17.8 million contract from NASA to provide the module to the space station. \"Today is the first step, but it's a big step,\" said Bigelow's George Zamka. Replace the space station or make it larger. It also hopes to build the habitats on the moon. Its B330 module would be even bigger, with 330 cubic meters of internal ( ) space. The modules could be connected. Creating research facilities, the company says, or even space hotels. In an interview ,NASA's William  Gerstenmaier, said he was eager to see how the module performs , and said he was especially  pleased \" to see how the private sector can step up and help us meet our requirements.\" The module will be flown to the space station by SpaceX, the first commercial company to resupply the space station.\nAnswer: Question: The passage is most probably taken from   _  .Options:A a newspaperB a bookletC a magazineD a science fictionAnswer:A\n\n[Q]: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Our surroundings are being polluted faster than nature and man's present efforts cannot prevent it. Time is bringing us more people, and more people will bring us more industry, more cars, larger cities, and the growing use of man-made materials. What can explain and solve this problem? The fact is that pollution is caused by man--by his desire for a modern way of life. We make \"increasing industrialization\" our chief aim. So we are often ready to offer everything: clean air, pure water, good food, our health and the future of our children. There is a constant flow of people from the countryside into the cities, eager for the benefits of our modern society. But as our technological achievements have grown in the last twenty years, pollution has become a serious problem. Isn't it time we stopped to ask ourselves where we are going--and why? It makes one think of the story about the airline pilot who told his passengers over the loudspeaker, \"I've some good news and some bad news. The good news is that we're making rapid progress at 530 miles per hour.

Professionals seek career experience outside of their home countries for a variety of reasons. They may feel the need to recharge their batteries with a new challenge. They may want a position with more responsibility that encourages creativity and initiative . Or they may wish to expose their children to another culture, and the opportunity to learn a second language. When applying for a job, one usually has to hand in a resume or curriculum vitae (CV). The two terms generally mean the same thing: one or two pages describing one's educational qualifications and professional experience. However, guidelines for preparing a resume are constantly changing. The best advice is to find out what is suitable regarding the corporation culture, the country culture, and the culture of the person making the hiring decision. The challenge will be to include two or more cultures in one page. The following list is a good place to start. * Educational requirements differ from country to country. In almost every case of 'crossborder' job hunting, just stating the title of your degree will not be an adequate description. Provide the reader with details about your studies and any related experience. * Pay attention to the resume way you use: chronological or reversechronological order. Chronological order means listing your 'oldest' work experience first. Reversechronological order means listing your current or most recent experience first. Most countries have preferences about which way is most acceptable. If you find no specific guidelines, the general preference is for the reversechronological way. * If you hand in your resume in English, find out if the recipient   uses British English or American English because there are differences between the two versions.

Paper airplanes typically benefit from adding what\u2019s known as up elevator. Take the back end of the airplane, which on a standard dart-shaped plane is the wing tips, and use your finger to bend them upwards a little. This counterbalances the weight in the nose of your plane. Most planes also benefit from a little weight in the nose. This helps balance the plane so it doesn\u2019t have a tendency to fly straight up. Cover the nose in a layer or two of tape or add a paper clip. Test out out the plane and make adjustments as necessary.  Most airplanes are better off being slightly nose heavy rather than slightly tail heavy. Heavier planes are better at withstanding outdoor flight. Bending the wing tips downwards is only useful for planes that try to fly upwards when launched. Use your fingers to bend them down slightly. Try throwing the plane again. If this isn\u2019t enough to balance it, you can try adding more weight to the nose of the plane. Slightly bend the end of the tail to the left. If your tail has two sides, bend the left side up and the right side down. When the air hits the bends, the plane will change the plane\u2019s direction. If your plane has a single, vertical edge for a tail, bend it to the right. Otherwise, pull the right side up and the left side down.

Mix the ingredients well with a spoon to ensure that they\u2019re fully combined.  You can grind your own fenugreek seeds, but store-bought powder works just as well. For the mask, full fat yogurt usually works best. It delivers protein to the hair to help strengthen it and heal damage. Add more of the yogurt and oil if you have long and/or thick hair. When the ingredients are combined, cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap. Next, let it sit for 2 to 3 hours to allow the mask to thicken up. If the mask is too thick after it\u2019s sat, you can add up to \u00bc cup (59 ml) of distilled water to thin the mixture. Once the mask has thickened for a couple of hours, apply it to your hair and scalp. Allow the mask to sit on your head for 20 to 30 minutes. It\u2019s not necessary to cover your head because the mask won\u2019t drip. However, placing a shower cap or plastic wrap over it can help warm the mask so your hair absorbs it more easily. When it\u2019s time to take off the mask, rinse it away with warm water. Next, use your usual shampoo and conditioner to wash your hair, and allow it to air dry.

Ask for their phone number so you can contact them. Be direct by simply asking, \u201cCan I get your phone number?\u201d If you sense that they would prefer to be in control on contacting you, offer to give them your number by saying, \u201cHere\u2019s my phone number. Call me this week so we can set something up for the weekend.\u201d Calling them promptly shows that you are interested in them and that you take them seriously. If you haven\u2019t already set a specific time and place for your date, have a specific idea in mind to invite them to when you call. Being indecisive can be a turn-off for some people and if you call without a specific idea in mind, it may seem like you don\u2019t respect them enough to plan ahead. Even if all their body language indicates they are attracted to you, there is still a possibility the person could turn you down for a date. Tell them that you really enjoyed talking to them and that you wish them the best before parting ways with them.  There are many different reasons that a person might turn you down for a date. They may be attracted to you, but have something going on in their life that makes it difficult for them to date, such as if they have a demanding job, like modeling, acting, or nursing, or if they have to travel a lot. They may also have just gotten out of a serious relationship and may not be ready to date again. Or maybe they just don\u2019t find you as attractive as you thought they did. Rejection does not mean that you did anything wrong; it\u2019s just not the right fit with this person at this moment in time. Appreciate that it can be difficult to be honest with someone when they are asking you out on a date. If this person tells you upfront that they do not want to date you, they are being more courageous than giving you their phone number and then never answering your calls.\nQuestion: What is a summary of what this article is about?\n"}], "response": "Ask the person on a date.

To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy.

Tito was a backer of independent roads to socialism (sometimes referred to as \"national communism\"). In 1951 he implemented a self-management system that differentiated Yugoslavia from other socialist countries. A turn towards a model of market socialism brought economic expansion in the 1950s and 1960s and a decline during the 1970s. His internal policies included the suppression of nationalist sentiment and the promotion of the \"brotherhood and unity\" of the six Yugoslav nations. After Tito's death in 1980, tensions between the Yugoslav republics emerged and in 1991 the country disintegrated and went into a series of wars and unrest that lasted the rest of the decade, and which continue to impact most of the former Yugoslav republics.

Good relations with a supervisor at work can provide relief from tensions that children feel at school and home.

The band released Lost Dogs, a two-disc collection of rarities and B-sides, and Live at the Garden, a DVD featuring the band's July 8, 2003 concert at Madison Square Garden through Epic Records in November 2003. In 2004, Pearl Jam released the live album, Live at Benaroya Hall, through a one-album deal with BMG. 2004 marked the first time that Pearl Jam licensed a song for usage in a television show; a snippet of the song \"Yellow Ledbetter\" was used in the final episode of the television series Friends. Later that year, Epic released rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991\u20132003), a Pearl Jam greatest hits collection spanning 1991 to 2003. This release marked the end of Pearl Jam's contractual agreement with Epic Records.Pearl Jam played a show at Easy Street Records in Seattle in April 2005; recordings from the show were compiled for the Live at Easy Street album and released exclusively to independent record stores in June 2006. The band embarked on a Canadian cross-country tour in September 2005, kicking off the tour with a fundraising concert in Missoula, Montana for Democratic politician Jon Tester, then playing the Gorge Amphitheater before crossing into Canada. After touring Canada, Pearl Jam proceeded to open a Rolling Stones concert in Pittsburgh, then played two shows at the Borgata casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, before closing the tour with a concert in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The official bootlegs for the band's 2005 shows were distributed via Pearl Jam's official website in MP3 form. Pearl Jam also played a benefit concert to raise money for Hurricane Katrina relief on October 5, 2005, at the House of Blues in Chicago, Illinois.

The Three Sisters area was occupied by Amerindians since the end of the last glaciation, mainly the Northern Paiute to the east and Molala to the west. They harvested berries, made baskets, hunted, and made obsidian arrowheads and spears. Traces of rock art can be seen at Devils Hill, south of South Sister. The first Westerner to discover the Three Sisters was the explorer Peter Skene Ogden of the Hudson Bay Company in 1825. He describes \"a number of high mountains\" south of Mount Hood. Ten months later in 1826, the botanist David Douglas reported snow-covered peaks visible from the Willamette Valley. As the Willamette Valley was gradually colonized in the 1840s, Euro-Americans approached the summits from the west and probably named them individually at that time. Explorers, such as Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth in 1839 and John Fr\u00e9mont in 1843, used the Three Sisters as a landmark from the east. The area was further explored by John Strong Newberry in 1855 as part of the Pacific Railroad Surveys.In 1862, to connect the Willamette Valley to the ranches of Central Oregon and the gold mines of eastern Oregon and Idaho, Felix and Marion Scott traced a route over Scott Pass. This route was known as the Scott Trail, but was superseded in the early 20th century by the McKenzie Pass Road further north. Around 1866, there were reports that one of the Three Sisters emitted some fire and smoke.In the late 19th century, there was extensive wool production in eastern Oregon. Shepherds led their herds of 1,500 to 2,500 sheep to the Three Sisters. They arrived in eastern foothills near Whychus Creek by May or June, and then climbed to higher pastures in August and September. By the 1890s, the area was getting overgrazed. Despite regulatory measures, sheep grazing peaked in 1910 before being banned in the 1930s at North and Middle Sister, and in 1940 at South Sister.In 1892, President Grover Cleveland decided to create the Cascades Forest Reserve, based on the authority of the Forest Reserve Act of 1891.

In December 2008, MTV reported that DJ AM would be making his first appearance with Barker since the two survived the plane crash. The duo performed at New Year's Nation's Los Angeles 2008 New Year's Eve Party. That same month it was reported that Goldstein had split from Moore and was dating model Haley Wood. In April 2009, Goldstein left his position at Caesars Palace to become Rain Nightclub's regular Friday night DJ in the Palms Casino Resort, Las Vegas.Goldstein filmed a cameo for the movie Iron Man 2 in June 2009, appearing as himself deejaying at the birthday party of Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.). Jon Favreau, the film's director, said that he was a fan of Goldstein; the cameo was supposed to be filmed in one day but the crew and Downey Jr. took a liking to Goldstein and his stay on set extended to approximately one week. He set up turntables and gave Favreau tips on how to DJ in between takes. Goldstein was involved with Activision's DJ Hero video game, contributing original mixes to and also appearing as a playable character. Goldstein and Barker performed at an Electronic Entertainment Expo event promoting the game in 2009. Goldstein was the host of Gone Too Far, a drug intervention reality show for MTV. He had approached MTV in mid-2008, pitching the idea of a reality show that focused on his life to Tony DiSanto. DiSanto said that such shows were declining in popularity, and instead suggested a drug intervention show to which Goldstein agreed. The show was still in pre-production when Goldstein was injured in the plane crash. Following the crash, the show's producer Cheryl Sirulnick said she assumed the show would not go ahead, but Goldstein insisted on continuing. Eight episodes were filmed; three days before his death, Goldstein tweeted that filming had been completed.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe answer is:\n"}], "response": "DJ AM"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Photographs are everywhere. They decorate the walls of homes and are used in stores for sales of different goods. The news is filled with pictures of fires, floods, and special events. Photos record the beauties of nature. _ can also bring things close that are far away. Through photos, people can see wild animals, cities in foreign lands, and even the stars in outer space. Photos also tell stories. Reporting the news through photos is called photojournalism. At times photojournalists tell their stories through a single picture. At other times, they use a group of pictures to tell a story. Each picture is like a chapter in a book, which can do more than record the facts. It can also be a strong force for social change. Jacob Riis was among the first photojournalists. He took pictures of parts of New York City where the poor lived. Riis believed that poverty caused crime, and he used photos to help him prove his point. A few years later, the photos of small children working in factories by Lewis Hine shocked the public. Hine's pictures helped bring about laws to protect such children. Hundreds of pictures may have to be taken in order to get one or two really good photos. It takes science to have the photo come out clearly and art to make a photo that has a good design and expresses feeling. Photojournalists make an actual record of what they see. A photo, however, can be both a work of art and an actual record. It can record an important event as a beautiful or exciting picture. As historical and artistic documents,photos can become more important over time. Today photojournalists still have their pictures appear in newspapers and magazines.

Both parents know this. What has lead me to ask this question is this mornings reaction from parent B.\n\nThis morning parent b offered to make me breakfast, I responded how I always do: that\u2019s very kind but I\u2019m happy to come make it myself. Parent b said it was no trouble. I accepted. Two slices of toast came and apu I check the toast for signs of mould. First piece had no issues, I ate it. Second piece however had something green growing on the edge. I cut this bit off but I couldn\u2019t shake in my head that the whole piece must be contaminated and so I took the toast back and apologised that I couldn\u2019t eat it cos of the mould and we checked the date on the bread and it said the 30th December. Nearly a week past its best before. Parent b apologised and we threw it away. No drama.\n\nNearly identical situation occurred about 6 months ago with parent a. Parent a offered to make me a toasted sandwich. I said that would be very kind but I was happy to make it myself. Parent a said it was no problem, I accepted. When the sandwich came I checked the bread for mould and found green and white stuff growing down one side of the bread. I take it back to the kitchen and explain that it has mould and I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t eat it. I will make myself something else. Parent a goes ballistic. I\u2019m \u201cungrateful and don\u2019t trust them and did I really think they\u2019d feed me mould?\u201d I pointed out the mould- clearly visible. \u201cWell someone must\u2019ve not sealed the bread package properly (ie me) and that\u2019s how it got mouldy.\u201d I asked if parent a had checked the date and that just seemed to escalate their reaction. They stormed out screaming and crying. I checked the bread date and it was 2 or 3 days past the best before.\n\nAita in either situation? Parent a\u2019s reaction made me think I was. But now I\u2019ve had the same situation with parent b and they didn\u2019t get angry or pissed off maybe I wasn\u2019t the asshole? Obviously I think I need to just make my own food. Then I can\u2019t cause trouble.\nAnswer: yes\nExplanation: The post clearly mentions an event in the past when the author asked some questions to his/her parents and also describes about their reactions on that day. Hence this should be HISTORICAL.\nPart 3. Exercise\nCLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : Hello everyone, I just wanted to get some outside opinions on something that happened a few weeks ago. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I have been together for about 3 1/2 years, lived together for a little over a year, and he is a gem. His brother however, not so much. He is frequently racist, sexist, homophobic, and generally rude. He can\u2019t handle being called out on any of this behavior, and it often results in tears  or agitation if I try. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 knows how I feel about his brother, and feels the same way about a lot of it, but feels like I should be able to just put up with it as he is family. He also says that when we are married, he will take my side in any arguments that arise, but for now, he is staying neutral. This culminated a few weeks ago as my fianc\u00e9 let his brother stay with us for a weekend. \n\nIt is important to note that the weekend he stayed is the weekend of a music festival we go to every year in our city, and he has stayed with my fianc\u00e9 in the past every year. I have as well, so I have put up with him over this weekend in the past few years. Two of the years, it has coincided with my birthday, and this year was one of those years. \n\nI told my fianc\u00e9 for months leading up to this that I was very nervous about it, and he insisted that he was family and he would not ask him to stay elsewhere. When the weekend came around, his brother was his usual self (using gay slurs and ignoring/talking over us, me in particular as I am a woman and he does not like women, being generally racist and sexist) as well as being a terrible houseguest. For example, leaving pubes in our bathtub and sleeping on our bare couch in his underwear after refusing to put down a sheet that we provided, as well as not letting us use our own couch throughout the day as he would not stop laying on it. \n\nI have very bad anxiety, and having this type of stress in my home, which is typically my safe space to escape from everything, was making things very difficult for me. I had a few crying meltdowns in the privacy of our bedroom, and wasn\u2019t able to eat towards the end of the weekend as I was so anxious. On the last day, my fianc\u00e9 asked me what was wrong, and I told him his brother was making me anxious, and that even though he didn\u2019t want to choose sides between us, he absolutely had that weekend, and it wasn\u2019t mine. He then got very angry, told his brother his presence was making me anxious, and his brother got upset and left in tears.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 was very angry at me, as he thought I should have been able to suck it up, and that I ruined the weekend and music festival for them, and was upset he had to say that to his brother, even though I did not ask him to, in fact asked him to do the opposite. He has said he won\u2019t let his brother stay with us in the future because of this. \n\nAITA for not being able to handle being around my fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother for the weekend, and upsetting him and his brother? \nAnswer:"}], "response": "yes"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Parmi les principaux domaines de recherche de l\u2019IBP, mentionnons la technologie des brassicac\u00e9es, la biotechnologie des c\u00e9r\u00e9ales et des l\u00e9gumes, l\u2019expression g\u00e9n\u00e9tique, la r\u00e9gulation de la croissance des plantes, les acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateurs de croissance et la modification des huiles de graines.\n\nTranslate this to English?\n"}], "response": "Transgenic plant and DNA technologies help the Institute develop novel systems to analyze and manipulate genes, leading to state-of-the-art technologies and crop development."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "input: Please answer the following: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

An adolescent begins to develop a unique belief system through his or her interaction with social, familial, and cultural environments. While organized religion is not necessarily a part of every adolescent's life experience, youth are still held responsible for forming a set of beliefs about themselves, the world around them, and whatever higher powers they may or may not believe in. This process is often accompanied or aided by cultural traditions that intend to provide a meaningful transition to adulthood through a ceremony, ritual, confirmation, or rite of passage.\"?\n++++++++++\noutput: How do adolescents develop their religion?\n\n\ninput: Please answer the following: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Initially it was known as Bodhisattvay\u0101na (the \"Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas\"). Paul Williams has also noted that the Mah\u0101y\u0101na never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhik\u1e63u or bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012b adhering to the Mah\u0101y\u0101na formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore Mah\u0101y\u0101na was never a separate rival sect of the early schools. From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mah\u0101y\u0101na and non-Mah\u0101y\u0101na monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.\"?\n++++++++++\noutput: What religion do people in both China and India sometimes follow?\n\n\ninput: Please answer the following: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

This was summarised at the time by the slogan \"No taxation without representation\", a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen. The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the United States declared independence. The entry of France to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms.

These historians were generally unsympathetic to John's behaviour under Richard's rule, but slightly more positive towards the very earliest years of John's reign. Reliable accounts of the middle and later parts of John's reign are more limited, with Gervase of Canterbury and Ralph of Coggeshall writing the main accounts; neither of them were positive about John's performance as king. Much of John's later, negative reputation was established by two chroniclers writing after the king's death, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris, the latter claiming that John attempted conversion to Islam in exchange for military aid from the Almohad ruler Muhammad al-Nasir - a story which is considered to be untrue by modern historians.\"?\n++++++++++\noutput:"}], "response": "who wrote the story that is considered to be untrue by modern historians?"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Detailed Instructions: You will be asked how to do a certain task.

The Third Carnatic War spread beyond southern India and into Bengal where British forces captured the French settlement of Chandernagore in 1757. However, the war was decided in the south, where the British successfully defended Madras, and Sir Eyre Coote decisively defeated the French, commanded by Comte de Lally at the Battle of Wandiwash in 1760. After Wandiwash, the French capital of Pondicherry fell to the British in 1761. The war concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1763, which returned Chandernagore and Pondich\u00e9ry to France, and allowed the French to have \"factories\" in India but forbade French traders from administering them. The French agreed to support British client governments, thus ending French ambitions of an Indian empire and making the British the dominant foreign power in India.\nA: Which french settlement did the British capture first, Chandernagore or Pondicherry?\nRationale: This is a good question since it involves a comparison around a particular event, \"British capturing the French settlement\", which requires looking at more than a single sentence.\nQ: Passage: Tranmere started season 2016/17 brightly, top of the table at the end of August, gaining Gary Brabin the manager of the month.  However, form dipped which resulted in one goal scored in the next four games, with the 1-0 defeat to Sutton United on BT Sport resulting in Brabin being sacked on 18 September 2016.  Assistant manager, ex-Southport boss Paul Carden took the reins on an interim basis. On 6 October 2016, however, former Tranmere player Micky Mellon was appointed permanent manager. His first game in charge was against cross-border rivals Wrexham AFC, and a 2-0 victory for Tranmere.  Despite a 2nd-place finish and a club record 95 point haul, this still was not enough to gain automatic promotion back to the league.  Tranmere faced Aldershot Town in the playoffs.  A goal from James Norwood and a brace from Cole Stockton in the first leg away at the Recreation Ground (Aldershot) saw Rovers take a 3-0 aggregate lead back to Prenton Park for the second leg, which ended in a 2-2 draw, Norwood and Stockton once again on the scoresheet. This gave Tranmere a 5-2 aggregate win and their first Wembley appearance in 17 years.

At the nearby Nang Tao airport, Indiana escapes from Shanghai aboard a cargo plane -- though he fails to see that the plane belongs to Lao Che himself.En route to India, their plane crashes in the mountains, when the pilot and co-pilot bail out after dumping the plane's fuel. After a dangerous ride down the Himalayan mountains and a raging river in an inflatable life raft, the trio eventually come to a desolate village in India.

Assassins, accompanied by a corrupt Tuareg named Zakara, attempt to murder Eva, but she is rescued by Dirk Pitt, from National Underwater and Marine Agency, who was diving nearby. Dirk gets a call from a dealer in Nigeria. He sells Dirk a gold Confederate States of America coin, one of supposedly only five in existence, which was found in the Niger River. Dirk believes that this is a clue to the long-lost Texas. He convinces his boss, James Sandecker, to let him, Al Giordino, and Rudi Gunn, from NUMA, take Sandecker's yacht, the Calliope, up the Niger River to search for the Texas. They give Eva and Hopper a ride, so that they can continue their investigation, for the WHO. Businessman Yves Massarde and dictator General Kazim, who controls half of civil-war torn Mali, try to stop the doctors from discovering the source of the \"plague\". Kazim sends men to kill them and the NUMA team, not realizing their CIA and Navy background. Dirk, Al and Rudi survive the attack, but the Calliope is destroyed in the process.

Context: The swinging doors slammed open. Cedric looked over from where he was sitting on a lab stool, chewed thumbnail between his teeth. His shoulder length blond hair was coated with the shine of someone who has only wet their hair down and not washed. His red streaked eyes were a sure sign of his having been recently woken up. He watched Dorian backing his way through the doors pulling a gurney behind him. \"Dorian,\" Cedric said, then immediately fell silent as Dorian turned around. There was panic in Dorian's eyes and a waxy pallor beneath the stubble on his face that betrayed a lack of sleep. \"Dorian,\" Cedric said again, that one word betraying multiple emotions: a layer of fear spread over top concern for his friend, concern for his own wellbeing, and simple anger at letting himself become involved in this. \"Hook her up,\" Dorian said before moving to a lab stool of his own and sliding a keyboard across the table to rest in front of him, his fingers impatiently tapping the spacebar while he waited for the monitor to respond. With a hiccup of light the screen became active making Dorian's face even more hollow with its sickly glow. He was normally a handsome man with short brown hair that was always perfectly combed. Tonight, though, it was full of unruly licks and his white lab coat, which usually added to his presence as the overall leader of their research team, was cast by the computer's light into awkward shades of green and blue. A large coffee stain down the front appeared to still be wet. Cedric didn't respond. \"I said hook her up,\" Dorian said. \"Dorian,\" Cedric said for the third time. \"I said hook her up!\" Dorian screamed and Cedric jumped forward to the gurney. Coffee stain or no coffee stain, Dorian was a commanding presence. Question: What Cedric first thougth when Dorian told him to \"hook her up?\"?

Context: I frankly haven't the slightest idea what the difference is between a moka pot and a cafetiere, but I'm going to pretend I do. \"Delicious,\" I say, setting down my cup. \"Way better than that stuff you get at Starbucks.\" Everyone else nods their heads in agreement, but I can't help but wonder if they're just being polite. Jason is pouring cream into his cup with a practiced hand, letting the white stream fall from the pitcher's lip in a smooth and slender column that blooms across his coffee's surface like a carnivorous plant photographed in stop-motion. \"Did you hear about Tibet?\" he asks. \"Yeah,\" I say, \"Terrible.\" \"What's really shocking,\" says my boss, \"is the complete ignorance of, well, most of America about what's going on right now.\" \"Terrible.\" chimes in Jason. \"and what with the death of newspapers, soon practically no one will be able to easily come by a well-formed opinion.\" \"Did you hear the New York Times might be going bankrupt?\" my boss asks. \"Now that,\" Jason says, draining his cup, \"would be a tragedy.\" Our biscotti has arrived and I'm reluctant to take the first piece. Is Dr. Burns paying again? It makes me feel awkward, because and despite the fact that she paid the last time--and this was at her invitation. Jason, for all his savior faire, did not appear to know how a Turkish coffee tasting was really supposed to go last time, and did not question when Dr. Burns ordered for all of us. Tracy, similarly, followed the doctor's lead and silently acquiesced when she took the check from the waiter dressed in a vest and what I took be MC Hammer pants. At any rate, it's not too weird for the boss to pay, right? After last time, I had gone home and dug out a 1984 copy of Emily Post, but that wasn't much help.

Context: A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns. But what marvels, what miracles, what mysteries are hidden inside those simple words! Question: Patch will probably eat: Options: - not enough information - an acorn - the ice - bits of newspaper\n\nAns:"}], "response": "an acorn\n-----"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Translate to French:\n\nSummary records of the Committee 19.\n"}], "response": "Comptes rendus analytiques du Comit\u00e9 19."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Buy separately Review: Again the idiocy of more expensive full set DVDs.

Longstanding tensions in Detroit culminated in the Twelfth Street riot in July 1967. Governor George W. Romney ordered the Michigan National Guard into Detroit, and President Johnson sent in U.S. Army troops. The result was 43 dead, 467 injured, over 7,200 arrests, and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed, mostly in black residential and business areas.

Richard Cairns, the headmaster of Brighton College, said the move aims to recognize the importance of China as the world's fastest growing economy. Chinese will become one of the core subjects at the 1,200-pupil college from September. At present the school has only a \"handful\" of native Chinese students, but it hopes to attract more in the future. Mr Cairns, who made the announcement in his first week as head of the high-achieving college, said, \"One of my key tasks is to make sure that the pupils at Brighton College are equipped for the realities of the 21st century, and one of those realities is that China has the fastest growing economy in the world. \"China has replaced Britain as the world's fourth-largest economy. We in Britain need to face up to this challenge, see it for the trading opportunity that it is, and ensure that our nation's children are well-placed to thrive   in this new global reality. \"A better understanding of the language and culture of China will be hugely important to the advantage of the children of Brighton College.\" Mr Cairns said he hoped the Chinese children already at the college would help and encourage their fellow pupils to learn their language. In order to lead the way, Mr Cairns, a historian from Oxford, plans to take part in the first Chinese class as a pupil. \"I have agreed to join the first Chinese class as a pupil.

But the \"chalk and talk\" method helped them achieve better exam results. Modern classroom techniques may make school days a good deal happier, but contentment  is not the road to success in examinations, according to university researchers. Their three-year study, monitoring the progress of 2000 teenagers, tried to measure the influence of the \"boredom factor\" in 17 selected schools in the north of England. The researchers also found that the old-fashioned approach  of teachers ordering pupils about is still alive and producing results. Their conclusions were welcomed yesterday by educationists who were worried by the shift to less formal lessons. The pupils in the latest study were asked to award teachers marks to measure how frequently they followed or ignored today's fashion for \"child-centred\" education. A five-point scale was given to spot the teachers who always told them what they should know and what to write down. \"It was significant and not anything you would get by chance or accident. Certainly, when you compare the pupil's interest and attitude to school, there is a quite definite and highly significant difference,\" one of the researchers said. But the rankings were turned upside down when the team of four researchers looked at how the children did in examination. The sort of methods now frowned upon  actually improve the final grades. The researchers said,\"There is nothing wrong with old-fashioned, didactic  teaching in the fight place, even if it isn't the flavor at the moment.\" However, he insisted the best teachers had always mixed the two techniques to match the needs of pupils, although certain examinations forced some to concentrate more on dictation and learning by rote .

It was my friend Lydia,upset over an argument with her husband. My usual approach is to offer advice,but this time,exhausted from chores,I simply sat down in a chair and listened to my friend's frustration  and sadness. Without the disturbance of judgment or the desire to comfort her,I stayed totally quiet while she talked. Eventually Lydia's depression eased and we said our goodbyes. The next day she phoned to thank me. \"I'm so grateful for the way you helped me through this,\"she said. At first I was surprised. After all,I had done nothing except be there for her. But after I had my own venting    experience with another friend later that evening,I realized that my focused silence had some value. In fact,most relationship experts agree that talk is cheap;it's listening that's rare and valuable It allows you not only to hear what the other person is saying,but also to have a clear understanding of her thoughts and feelings. And for the speaker,that level of understanding translates into concern and respect. Unfortunately,listening isn't as easy as it sounds. Thanks  to  schedules  filled  with  family and work,multitasking has become a barrier   to listening. My tiredness may have been the only thing stopping me from folding  laundry or checking my email while Lydia talked that afternoon. Another barrier to listening is our listening system:Most of us take in only about half of what's being said during a conversation,according to the International Listening Association. Research shows that we speak at 125 to 150 words per minute,yet think at 500 words a minute. Therefore,because we think much more quickly than we  speak,it is easy for us to lose our concentration when  listening to speakers. While it can be hard to focus at times,it's a skill worth developing. With a little practice  (employing some techniques),you can become a better listener. Question: Why didn't the author give any advice to Lydia that afternoon? Yes or no, is the answer \"Because she was too tired to talk to Lydia.\"?\n"}], "response": "A: No"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

A possible cause for this resistance is the overexpression of efflux drug transporters, e.g. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may decrease extracellular antiepileptic drugs levels in brains of intractable epilepsy patients. Another transmembrane drug transporter is the organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 (Oatp2), which is colocalized with P-gp in many polarized tissues. However, a role for Oatp2 in the development of multidrug resistance has not been established. In the present work, we investigated the expression of drug transporters Oatp2 and P-gp in brain, liver and kidney of rats with chronic epilepsy induced by lithium-pilocarpine.', 'Chronic epilepsy was elicited after status epilepticus (SE) induced by lithium-pilocarpine in adult Wistar rats. Following SE, expression of Oatp2 and P-gp protein was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis and messenger RNA (mRNA) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Levels of the drug transporters were compared in brain, liver and kidney of chronic epileptic and control rats.', 'Both Oatp2 and P-gp were expressed in the brain, liver and kidney but predominantly in the brain. In the brain, Oatp2 and P-gp immunopositive cells were observed in brain capillary endothelium and choroid plexus epithelium. Compared with control rats, Oatp2 protein expression in brain was significantly decreased, while P-gp was obviously increased in chronic epileptic rats. P-gp mRNA was also significantly higher in brains of chronic epileptic rats, whereas the expression of Oatp2 did not change. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 and P-gp did not change at the mRNA or protein level with epilepsy in the liver or kidney.\nAnswer: Organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 and P-gp colocalized in tissues that are important in drug absorption, metabolism and excretion. Seizures seem to induce the cerebral changes of P-gp and Oatp2. However, the changes of expression of two transporters exhibit the opposite trend. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 might play a different role than P-gp in intractable epilepsy. Our data provide a basis for the assessment of the role of uptake transporters and efflux pumps in the development of intractable epilepsy.\nA:"}], "response": "Are drug transporters altered in brain , liver and kidney of rats with chronic epilepsy induced by lithium-pilocarpine?"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "[Q]: \"She thanked the Director-General and his dedicated staff for their careful preparation of the session, and wished participants a successful session and a very pleasant stay in Vienna.\" --> French?\n[A]: Enfin, elle souhaite aux participants un agr\u00e9able s\u00e9jour \u00e0 Vienne.\n\n[Q]: \"The purpose in reviewing changes in the cost-recovery schedule is to optimize all three objectives to the greatest extent possible.\" --> French?\n[A]: L'examen des modifications du syst\u00e8me de recouvrement vise \u00e0 optimiser ces trois objectifs dans toute la mesure possible.\n\n[Q]: \"We also reached out to Canadians with new programming and new resources, much of it online.\" --> French?\n[A]:"}], "response": "Nous nous sommes \u00e9galement rapproch\u00e9s des Canadiens en leur offrant l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 de nouveaux programmes et \u00e0 de nouvelles ressources, en ligne pour la plupart."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "input: Please answer the following: Process: - As the sweat evaporates the sweat sheds molecules into the air - The sweat changes into a gas - Heat is drawn from the sweat - This process draws heat from the body - The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body.

(September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1625 France, following in his late father's footsteps, d'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell) sets off to Paris in hopes of becoming a member of the Musketeers, a band of men sworn to serve and protect the King of France. d'Artagnan is pursued by G\u00c3\u00a9rard and his brothers, who accuse him of blemishing their sister's honor. G\u00c3\u00a9rard saw his sister kissing d'Artagnan goodbye or as d'Artagnan put it \"she wanted to give me something to remember her by!\" At Musketeer Headquarters, Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the Cardinal's Guards have disbanded the Musketeers as per the orders of Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry), the King's Minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with England. Rochefort confides to the Cardinal that there are three Musketeers that have refused to relinquish their duties: Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charlie Sheen). Upon reaching Paris, the headstrong d'Artagnan has a series of chance physical encounters with these same three Musketeers, resulting in d'Artagnan's accepting a duel with each one that very day. D'Artagnan arrives at the Ruins for his first duel; and, much to his surprise, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reveal themselves as Musketeers. But, before the duels can commence, the Captain of the Cardinal's Guard appears with orders to arrest the resistant Musketeers. Although d'Artagnan himself is not under arrest, he joins the three Musketeers in the ensuing skirmish, aligning himself with them. Displeased (but still impressed) by d'Artagnan's involvement, the Three Musketeers leave d'Artagnan behind. More of the Cardinal's Guards, led by Rochefort, arrive; and d'Artagnan is captured. During an escape attempt, d'Artagnan is able to eavesdrop on a conversation between Cardinal Richelieu and Milady de Winter (Rebecca De Mornay),...\nAnswer:"}], "response": "Aramis"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.\nIn this task, you are given two statements.

Good morning, Professor McKay. I've heard that you and your team have just completed a report on old age. W: That's right. Well, the report basically look into the various beliefs that people hold about old age and tries to prove them. M: And what do you think your report can achieve? W: We hope that it will somehow help people to change their feelings about old age. The problem is that far too many of us believe that most old people are poor, lonely, and unhappy. As a result, we tend to find old people, as a group, unattractive. And this is very dangerous for our society. M: But surely we cannot escape the fact that many old people are lonely and many are sick. W: No, we can't. But we must also remember that the proportion of such people is no greater among the 60-70 age group than among the 50-60 age group. M: In other words, there is no more mental illness, for example, among the 60s-70s than among the 50s-60s. W: Right! M: Are people's mental abilities affected by old age? W: Certain changes do take place as we grow older, but this happens throughout life. These changes are very gradual and happen at different times with different people, but, in general, if you know a person well in his middle age and have seen how he deals with events and problems, you will easily recognize him in an old age.

Their feeding behavior is similar in many ways, however they are noted for their close association with their host species. While a grazing species such as an elephant may travel many kilometers in a single day, grazing on many plants in the process, parasites form very close associations with their hosts, usually having only one or at most a few in their lifetime. This close living arrangement may be described by the term symbiosis, \"living together\", but unlike mutualism the association significantly reduces the fitness of the host. Parasitic organisms range from the macroscopic mistletoe, a parasitic plant, to microscopic internal parasites such as cholera. Some species however have more loose associations with their hosts. Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) larvae may feed parasitically on only a single plant, or they may graze on several nearby plants.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  After their flight is cancelled due to stormy weather, neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Bass and photojournalist Alex Martin hire private pilot Walter to get them to Denver for connecting flights to Alex's wedding in New York and Ben's emergency surgery appointment in Baltimore. Walter, who has not filed a flight plan, suffers a fatal stroke mid-flight, and the plane crashes on a mountaintop in the High Uintas Wilderness. Ben, Alex, and Walter's dog survive the crash with various injuries. Alex thinks Ben has a better chance of finding help if he leaves her behind, but Ben refuses. Stranded for days with dwindling supplies, Alex grows skeptical that they will be rescued, although Ben wants to wait for help by the plane's wreckage. After arguing, Alex starts a lone descent down the mountain. Ben catches up and they make-up over past grievances.  Alex falls into freezing water near an abandoned cabin. They stay there for several days while Alex recuperates, and they have sex. Ben reveals that his wife died two years prior from a brain tumor. As Ben sleeps, Alex takes his picture. Later, she again asks Ben to leave her behind to find help. Ben initially agrees but soon returns; they press forward again.  The dog alerts them to a nearby timber yard. On their way toward it, Ben's leg gets caught in a bear trap. Alex cannot free him, but she reaches the yard and collapses in front of an approaching truck. Ben awakens in a hospital and goes to Alex's room, where he finds her with Mark, her fianc\u00e9. After a brief discussion, Ben leaves heartbroken. Some time after, Mark discovers Alex is no longer in love with him.\n----\nAnswer: Alex Martin\nQ: What is the name of the album that received mixed reviews and drew criticism for its digital release strategy?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Throughout the 360\u00b0 Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \"Ordinary Love\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \"Invisible\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \"sneak preview\" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. The release made the album available to over 500 million iTunes customers in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called \"the largest album release of all time.\" Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US$100 million on a promotional campaign. Songs of Innocence recalls the group members' youth in Ireland, touching on childhood experiences, loves and losses, while paying tribute to their musical...\nA: Songs of Innocence\nQuestion: What are the two sites of the car crashes?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Tired of playing second banana to Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck demands his own cartoon from Warner Bros., but is promptly fired. Aspiring stuntman DJ Drake is asked to escort Daffy off the studio lot, but the ensuing chase leads to the Batmobile demolishing the studio water tower. DJ is also fired in the process, and returns home with Daffy hitching a ride, discovering his father, action film star, Damian Drake, is actually a secret agent. Damian instructs his son to travel to Las Vegas, find his associate Dusty Tails, and gain the mystical \"blue monkey\" diamond, but he is shortly thereafter captured by the Acme Corporation, led by the childish Mr. Chairman. DJ and Daffy head for Vegas. Meanwhile, Bugs' routines fall apart without Daffy, so \"Vice-President of Comedy\" Kate Houghton is sent to rehire Daffy or face being fired herself. Bugs informs Kate of the situation, so they steal Damian's spy car, and pursue DJ and Daffy. In Las Vegas, DJ and Daffy meet Dusty in a casino owned by Acme operative Yosemite Sam. Dusty gives them a strange playing card, but when Sam attempts to kill them, they flee in the spy car with Bugs and Kate. The spy car, which can also fly, crashes in the Nevada desert. The group eventually stumbles upon Area 52, run by a woman called 'mother', who informs them of the situation, and plays a video recording, which reveals that Acme intends on using the blue monkey to transform mankind into monkeys to manufacture their products, before turning them back into human beings to purchase them. Marvin the Martian, imprisoned in the facility, escapes and leads a group of fellow alien inmates to obtain the playing card, but the heroes escape. Seeing that the card has Mona Lisa's face on it, the group conclude they must view the painting in the Louvre, located in Paris.\nAnswer: Nevada desert\nWho overpays Tom?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The film begins with the opening credits of a typical Star Wars fanfilm entitled \"Bond of the Force\". Gregory plays Jacen Solo, and Jennifer plays the offscreen voice of Jaina Solo. Jacen is on a forest planet searching for Anakin Solo, but only encountering a Sith Lord named Darth Katai, played by Zarth. The two begin to duel, and it is an intense battle...until Greg misses his cue, incurring the wrath of writer-director Tom \"Servo\" Harrison. Tom gets into a fight with his friends, and they walk out on him. After a monologue based on High Fidelity, with Star Wars in the place of rock music, Tom reflects back a few months to the genesis of the fanfilm project. Tom, Greg, Jenny, and Zarth are seen hanging out at Excalibur Games, a hobby shop, playing the Star Wars pants game. Tom is revealed to be an employee at the store, working for store credit while he has his money saved up for film school. He claims the only downside to the job is the trekkies\u2014specifically, two irate, Star Wars-hating ones named James and Stewart. The two enter the store, arguing over a discrepancy between the film Star Trek Generations and the Technical Manual. While waiting for Tom to get their new Star Trek cards, Stewart accidentally spills soda on a set of comics that Greg's boss ordered. Tom demands they pay for the damaged goods, and the Trekkies overpay him before leaving the store in a rush. Tom realizes that they can sell the undamaged books to Greg's boss for full price and pocket the money from the Trekkies. At Greg's suggestion, Tom combines the money with his remaining store credit and buys model lightsabers, which prompts the idea in his mind of making a Star Wars fanfilm.\n----\nAnswer:"}], "response": "James"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Answer the following question: Title: Pretty good Product review: This is a great bubble machine, but its made to set still in one place for it to work.

Without thinking we consult our internal list of \u201cthings that make me, ME\u201d and find ourselves recalling words like \u201ccreative, outgoing, photography, guitar\u201d before we\u2019ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: \u201cHow we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives\u201d. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it\u2019s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of \u2018a day in the life\u2019. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of \u2018the everyday\u2019. To create a sense of \u2018the day\u2019 or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Why did the author change his views about what was the best representation of himself?

Some have called it the most influential show in the history of television. American Idol has been extremely successful in the country since 2002. The show was number one for six years! The most popular episode had nearly 38 million _ . But why is the show so popular? The idea of the show is this: everyday people get a chance to show their singing talents to the world and become an \"American Idol\", a famous pop star. Anyone in the country(between the ages of 15 and 28) can have a try--a chance of becoming world famous. In fact, everyday people are the ones who are allowed on the show. If you are a professional singer--you cannot be an American Idol. The winners are regular people from small towns--people who sang in churches or bars but had bigger dreams. The winners of the contest don't get a prize of money. Instead, they get to record an album. Famous stars such as Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood gained fame  from winning the show. So, it seems the contest really works. It is the idea that anyone can be a super star that draws people to this program. All those hours of practicing in front of the mirror could lead to fame and fortune .Even you could be the next \"American Idol\". ,.

Most other injuries happen suddenly. For example, if you fall off a bike and break your arms, it happens very quickly. But computer injuries slowly. You probably know how to ride a bike safely. Now learn to use a computer safely. Your eyes Too much light can injure your eyes, so never sit too close to a computer screen. Your eyes should be at least 50 centimeters from the screen. Remember to look away from it sometimes. This gives your eyes a rest. When you use a computer, the window should be on your left or your right. If it is behind you, the light will reflect on   the screen. If the window is in front of you, the sun and the screen will both shine into your eyes. Your hands and wrists   Hand and wrist injuries can happen because the hands and wrists are moved in the same way hundreds of times. If you use a keyboard for a long time, follow these three rules: 1) Rest your wrists on something. 2) Keep your elbows at the same height as the keyboard. 3) Stop something and exercise your hands, wrists and fingers in a different way. Your back Some people sit for many hours in front of a computer. If you sit in the wrong way, you can injure your back or your neck. So you should sit with your back straight. The top part of the screen should all be in front of your eyes. Your forearms, wrists, hands and the upper part of your legs should all be parallel   to the floor. If you are sitting for a long time, get up every 30 minutes and exercise your arms, legs and necks. Enjoy your computer, but use it safely. Options: A How to protect your eyes.

It's just barren   land there! So why even call it a town? There are more than 4,000 people of 48 nationalities. However, all of the people live underground! Coober Pedy was established  in 1915, following the discovery of opals  . The town is sometimes called the \"opal capital of the world,\" because it is the largest opal mining area in the world. Due to a desert climate  , people came to realize that while working under the ground was easy, living above it was not. The solution was to move underground, by changing old mines into homes and establishing the world's first and most likely, only underground town. As years have gone by, the homes have become bigger. There are now also some hotels for tourists. They come from all over the world just to see this unusual town. Coober Pedy is probably best known for its unique style  of underground living. While the structures  may be located underground, they are in no way worse than those that lie above. Not only do their walls have the color of beautiful red, but also the structures have all the modern equipment like walk-in closets, modern kitchens and televisions. And the town also has gift shops selling opal jewelry, a couple of museums and even a church! Besides, Coober Pedy is also a favourite among filmmakers. And it has appeared in a series of movies such as Pitch Black, Red Planet and Opal Dream.

Luckily my curiosity got the better of me and I finally took a chance... and my husband and I have been regulars there ever since.   This is not your boring chain establishment. Gino's is a fun and friendly neighborhood eatery and bar. They have poker most nights and dart tournaments, trivia contests, ladies nights with champagne and massages on other nights. Even during their 'quiet times' the staff is fun and friendly and always makes our visit a pleasure.... and then there's the food. I've been going there for a few months now and have made it a point to try different things. I've only been disappointed in two items and one of those was just a personal preference. (The french bread pizza didn't have enough sauce and wasn't cooked enough even after being sent back. The meat loaf is not what I am used to with its brown gravy. I'm a ketchup meat loaf kinda gal so it wasn't what I expected... but it wasn't too bad.) The portions are always more than enough and the prices are always much less than you'd expect.  There are two reasons that I didn't give them a 5 star rating... they rarely have all of the desserts listed on the menu (and there aren't that many) and they have a NO FIREARMS sign out front.

I can think of several places with better fish tacos so I do not understand what the fuss is all about.  If you like a better fish taco at a good price in this area, go to Habeneros.  It is a shame Rumbies is now out of business, it was a far superior meal at a better price.  If you think paying $11 for a 2 mediocre fish tacos is acceptable, then go ahead and try it.

I add some salt and pepper to the mix for flavor . I pour the mixture into the hot frying pan . I make sure that I add some vegetable oil to the pan before I add the eggs though because I do n't want them to stick . As this occurs , I add some cheese or vegetable to the center of the egg mixture . Really , almost any type of cheese or vegetable makes a good omelette .

Wayne informs Connor that, over the course of the evening, he will be visited by three ghosts who will lead him through his romantic past, present, and future. The first ghost is the \"Ghost of Girlfriends Past\" in the form of Allison Vandermeersh (Emma Stone), one of his high school girlfriends and his first lover. Together, they revisit scenes from his past, focusing on his relationship with Jenny. Connor and Jenny were very close as children; she gave him his first instant camera which he used to take her picture, promising to keep it forever. By middle school, the two were on the verge of romance, but Connor's hesitation at a dance caused Jenny to dance with and kiss another boy. Heartbroken, Connor was told by Wayne that he must avoid romance at all costs in order not to feel such pain again. For the next two years, Wayne schooled Connor in the art of seduction. When he next saw Jenny, at a high school party, Connor ignored her and had sex with Allison. Several years later, as adults, Connor and Jenny rekindled their romance, but Jenny forced him to woo her for several weeks in an attempt to rid him of his womanizing ways. After they finally did have sex, Connor falls in love with her, but then panics, running out on her so he won't be hurt. Jenny wakes up alone and broken-hearted.

Shack has an arsenal of makeshift weapons: a hammer, a steel rod, and a chain. A hobo who is a hero to his peers, A-No.1, manages to hop the train with the younger, less-experienced Cigaret close behind. At the next stop, A-No.1 evades Shack and escapes into the hobo jungle, but Cigaret is caught. Shack threatens to kill Cigaret for riding his train for free, who is bragging that he and he alone did it. Shack is distracted when he learns that A-No.1 has posted a notice on the yard water tower, announcing that he will become the first hobo to ride Shack's train all the way to Portland. The other hobos agree that the first who can successfully ride Shack's train will have earned the title \"Emperor of the North Pole.\" Railroad workers place bets whether A-No.-1 can do it, spreading the news far and wide over the telegraph, Shack being widely known and disliked. A-No.1 hops the train and does everything he can to steer clear of Shack, pulling a series of pranks with the help of other hobos, such as running Shack's train into a siding and greasing the tracks, almost causing it to crash head on into an oncoming mail train. He tries to rid himself of the company of Cigaret, who tags along and makes a general pest of himself. Shack succeeds in ejecting the two, but they board a fast passenger train which overtakes Shack's train and ride it to Salem, Oregon. There, they have several farcical encounters, including one with a policeman who chases the two into the Salem hobo jungle, accusing them of stealing a turkey. They also encounter a Holiness minister holding an outdoor baptism service. The two hobos reboard Shack's train after it arrives in Salem.

He seeks out the expertise of Lt. Colonel John Henry Patterson, a British military engineer, to get the project back on track. Patterson travels from England to Tsavo, telling his wife, Helena, he will complete the project and be back in London for the birth of their son. He meets British supervisor Angus Starling, African foreman Samuel, and Doctor David Hawthorne. Hawthorne tells Patterson of a recent lion attack that has affected the project. That night, Patterson kills an approaching lion with one shot, earning the respect of the workmen and bringing the project back on schedule. However, not long afterwards, Mahina, the construction foreman, is dragged from his tent in the middle of the night. His half-eaten body is found the next morning. Patterson then attempts a second night-time lion hunt, but the following morning, another worker is found dead at the opposite end of the camp from Patterson's position. Patterson's only comfort now is the letters he receives from his wife. Soon, while the workers are gathering wood and building fire pits around the tents, a lion attacks the camp in the middle of the day. While Patterson, Starling and Samuel are tracking it to one end of the camp, another lion leaps upon them from the roof of a building, killing Starling with a slash to the throat and injuring Patterson. Despite the latter's efforts to kill them, both lions escape. Samuel states that there has never been a pair of man-eaters; they have always been solitary hunters. The men, led by Abdullah, begin to turn on Patterson. Work on the bridge comes to a halt. Patterson requests soldiers from England to protect the workers, but is denied. During a visit to the camp, Beaumont tells Patterson he will ruin his reputation if the bridge is not finished on time and that he will contact the famous hunter Charles Remington to help because Patterson has been unable to...\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe answer is:\n"}], "response": "The Ghost and the Darkness"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which society will have higher rates of homicide?  Hint: Research has shown an inverse link between income inequality and social cohesion. In more equal societies, people are much more likely to trust each other, measures of social capital (the benefits of goodwill, fellowship, mutual sympathy and social connectedness among groups who make up a social units) suggest greater community involvement, and homicide rates are consistently lower.\n****\n[A]: society A\n\n\ninput: Please answer the following: Pat and Tammy are mother and sister. They like to take long walks together. Pat is 60, while Tammy is 32 years-old.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person shows more gray hair?  Hint: Middle adulthood lasts from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. During this stage of life, many people raise a family and strive to attain career goals. They start showing physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair. Typically, vision, strength and reaction time start declining. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease, and cancer are often diagnosed during this stage of life. These diseases are also the chief causes of death in middle adulthood.\n++++++++++\noutput: Pat\n\n\nPlease answer this: Marcy is in her kitchen and fills one blue cup with water and then sticks that cup in the freezer. She then takes a green cup and fills that one with water but sets that one out on the kitchen counter. Three hours later, Marcy returns and takes the cup out of the freezer and dumps the now frozen water out onto a plate to look at it and compare it to the water that has been sitting on the kitchen counter.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Has the water in the green cup expanded more or less than the water in the blue cup?  Hint: Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F). Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice.\n++++++++\nAnswer: less\n\n\nProblem: John is an amateur astronomer. Last week he was observing the sky with his telescope. First he pointed his telescope at planet Mars. He noted it as case A. Then he pointed his telescope to planet Jupiter, which is farther form the Sun than Mars is. He noted it as case C. Finally, he pointed the telescope to a faraway planet called WASP-17b. He noted that as case B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which case would have shorter year, case A or case C?  Hint: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \"rogue planets\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:\n\nA: case A\n\n\nProblem: Given the question: In a greenhouse, two new plants have just been planted. Flower D has come from a region of little rainfall. Flower E was taken from an area that sees rain nearly every day of the year.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which flower would be better at handling not being watered for a long period of time?  Hint: One interesting thing that has been found in plants that are consistently exposed to drought, is their ability to form a sort of \"memory\". In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \"hydraulic safety margin\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe answer is:\nFlower D\n\n\nProblem: Russian research spent most of their time in Antarctica to study the loss of ozone in the atmosphere. The Canadian team went north of the Polar Circle, close to the North Pole to do the same thing. They spent several months there. The Canadian team didn't find any ozone holes at the North Pole.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which team was less exposed to skin cancers?  Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.\n\nA:"}], "response": "Canadian"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Translate \"It would take decades for the wall to be broken down.\" to French?\n"}], "response": "Il aura fallu des d\u00e9cennies pour abattre le mur."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown an English sentence.

A stylish, leather-upholstered interior is standard, as is a full-length panoramic sunroof. Mrs. Beckham was named Creative Design Executive to the Evoque program and her fashion business is currently collaborating with Land Rover on a special edition of the vehicle.\n\nPowered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine similar to the one available in the Explorer, the Evoque is fitted with an independent suspension with available adaptive dampers and an advanced all-wheel-drive system that promises the kind of off-road abilities Range Rover\u2019s vehicles have always been known for.

It starts with leggy strides across a big stage, and it ends with a fireworks show, and through all of the va-voom and ka-boom, a multimillionaire is trying to convince you that she simply wants to be your pal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m smiling so much,\u201d Swift told a worshipful crowd at Nationals Park on Monday night, lightly tweaking a stump speech about friendship that she has given at previous concerts. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m standing here with 45,000 of my friends.\u201d\n\nThis was one of numerous reminders throughout the night that Swift was playing her first of two sold-out gigs at Nats Park \u2014 and she presented this information as if it was her audience\u2019s accomplishment instead of hers. But it also posed a trickier question for the singer: Are there any more worlds for Swift to conquer?\n\nHer planet-eating fifth album, \u201c1989,\u201d recently passed the 5-million-sales mark in the United States, and on Monday night, Swift presented herself as the biggest pop star of her era at the height of her renown.\n\nShe put all of her resources into making the transaction feel personal, because, obviously, she\u2019s great at it. Instead of bridges, some of the loudest songs in the show were retro-fitted with simmering banter-breaks that allowed Swift to offer her adoring young flock various affirmations and life tips.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering what happened to that precocious teenage country singer who once seemed poised to pave her own six-lane highway through America\u2019s pop consciousness, she\u2019s gone now. Instead, grown-up Taylor Swift has chosen to reign over pop music\u2019s biggest, blandest center, singing one-size-fits-all hits that wouldn\u2019t sound that strange coming from the lungs of Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson, Demi Lovato or a dozen others on today\u2019s airwaves.\n\nAnd while that\u2019s disappointing in one sense, it was encouraging on Monday night to see Swift doubling down on the most recent entries in her songbook. Very much living in the present, she sang the sleekest tunes from \u201c1989\u201d as if she has been making this kind of music all along. Even \u201cLove Story,\u201d the only tune on the set list released before 2012, was excellently reimagined as a surging new wave ballad, heavy on synthesizers and doused in Aqua Net.\n\nBetween songs inspired by the boys foolish enough to burn her, there were Jumbotron testimonials from Swift\u2019s famous gal pals \u2014 Lena Dunham, Selena Gomez and the sisters of Haim among them. (The rock band Haim and singer-songwriters Vance Joy and Shawn Mendes were opening acts.) This felt like an attempt to erase the boy-crazy narrative that the media has unfairly attached to Swift, and it\u2019ll be interesting to see how this new gang of BFFs factor into Swift\u2019s future hits.\n\nOn Monday, fans had to settle for a surprise appearance from New Zealand phenom Lorde, whom Swift introduced halfway through the show as \u201cone of my best friends in the world!\u201d\n\nGliding across the stage, singing Lorde\u2019s breakout hit \u201cRoyals,\u201d the duet partners looked like the prom queen and the goth girl from third-period art class.

Article: Our \"Mommy and Me\" time began two years ago.    My next-door neighbor and fellow mother, Christie, and I were our in our front yards, watching seven children of age six and under ride their bikes up and down. \"I wish I could take one of my children out alone,\" said Christie. Then we worked out a plan. When Christie takes one of her children out alone, I'll watch her other three. And when she watched two of mine, I will take someone out.    The children were extremely quick to accept the idea of \"Mommy and Me\" time. Christie's daughter, McKenzie, went first. When she returned, the other children showered her with tons of questions. McKenzie was smiling broadly. Christie looked refreshed and happy. \"She is like a different kid when there's no one else around,\" Christie shared with me quietly. With her mother all to herself, McKenzie didn't have to make any effort to gain attention.    Just as Christie had noticed changes in McKenzie, I also discovered something different in each of my children during our alone times. For example, I'm always surprised when my daughter, who is seldom close to me, holds my hand frequently. My stuttering  son, Tom, doesn't stutter once during our activities since he doesn't have to struggle for a chance to speak. And the other son, Sam, who is always a follower when around other children, shines a leader during our times together.    The \"Mommy and Me\" time allows us to be simply alone and away with each child--talking, sharing and laughing, which has been the biggest gain. Every child deserves an only child at least once in a while. Question: What's one of the changes the author finds in her children? Options: A: Tom has less difficulty in speaking.

Article: Telephone, television, radio, telegraph and the Internet all help people communicate with each other. As a result, ideas and news of events spread quickly all over the world. For example, within seconds, people can know the results of an election in another country. An international football match comes into the homes of everyone with a television set. News of a disaster such as an earthquake or a flood can bring help from distant countries within hours. Help is on the way. Because of modern technology like the satellites that travel around the world, information travels fast. How has this speed of communication changed the world? To many people, the world has become smaller. Of course this does not mean that the world is actually physically smaller. It means that the world seems smaller. Two hundred years ago, communication between the continents took a long time. All news was carried on ships that took weeks or even months to cross the ocean. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it took six weeks for news from Europe to reach America. This time difference influenced people's actions. For example, one battle, or fight, in the War of 1812 between England and the United States could have been avoided. A peace agreement had already been signed. Peace was made in England, but the news of peace took six weeks to reach America. During these six weeks, the large and serious Battle of New Orleans was fought. Many people lost their lives after a peace treaty had been signed. They would not have died if news had come in time. In the past, communication took much more time than it does now. There was a good reason why the world seemed so much larger than it does today. Question: According to this passage,   _   is very important to people in a disaster area.

Article: Dealing with a difficult roommate can be both annoying and challenging. However, by becoming aware of the context of the situation, steps can be taken in order to improve the circumstance.

Therefore, it is important to find the one element that caused your anger to begin with. Evaluate the source of the conflict. Is the conflict _ , or is it serious ? Sometimes, people can become angry over things that seem like a big deal at the time, but when contemplated  , are really unimportant. Nevertheless, before any problem is dealt with, it is necessary to determine how serious it is. Talk to the roommate about what is bothering you. Communication is very important when dealing with problems. The problems will only become worse if measures are taken without telling one another what is even wrong to begin with. Listen to the explanation that the roommate has to over. Listening is also important when dealing with conflicts. Hearing each side of the story will make it easier to arrive at a possible solution.

You have to deal with new responsibilities and growing independence, a challenging course load and, of course, the social scene. When a roommate is thrown into the mix, it may feel like you're struggling with all that stuff while living in a small box with a stranger. But having a roommate doesn't need to be one more thing to worry about. When students go into their living situations with realistic expectations and a willingness to compromise, things can work out just fine. When you first meet your roommate, chances are you'll be on your best behaviour. You want to get along, since this is the person who's going to be sharing your living space for the next year. But try to think ahead to potential   worst cases, too. For example, imagine it's 2 a.m. and you're working on a paper that should be finished in 8 hours. Your roommate comes in from a party and wants to continue the party in your room. At times like these, you won't be feeling good. That's why talking about problems that might come up ahead of time -- and respecting each other's wishes when the time comes -- is so important. Talk about the things that are really important to you, and make sure your roommate understands. Then encourage him or her to do the same. For example, does it make you angry when people take things without asking first? Let your roommate know your feelings about these types of things from the start, so that both of you have a feel for each other's likes, dislikes, and habits. Question: You should try to be polite to your roommate because  _  . Options: A: you are glad to share the room with him or her B: you will live with him or her in the same room for some time C: you will ask him or her for help in the future D: strangers are very difficult to deal with\nAns: B\n\nQues: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Scientists have found what look like caves on Mars , and say they could be protecting life from the planet's terrible environment. The first caves discovered beyond the Earth appear as seven mysterious black dots on the pictures sent back by NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter. Each as large as a football field, they may be openings into natural caves below the Martian surface. \"If there is life on Mars, there is a good chance you'd find it in caves,\" said Jut Wynne, one of the researchers who noticed the features while working on a US Geological Survey Mars Cave Detection Program. Jonathan Clarke, a geologist with the Mars Society of Australia, yesterday described the discovery as exciting. One photo taken at night by an infrared imager  showed one hole to be unusually warm, suggesting hot air trapped during the day is flowing out. \"I said: 'Wow, that's a cave'\" Dr. Clarke said excitedly. \"People have been looking for these for a long time; now we have found them.\" He agreed such caves would be perfect places to hunt for life escaping from the bitterly cold, radiation-soaked , dry surface. \"Tiny drops of water could collect inside,\" he said. \"If there are gases coming out, they could provide energy for a whole range of bacteria. A cave is also a protection from radiation; the surface of Mars is exposed to high levels of space radiation.\" The caves probably formed when tube-shaped lave flows  spread across the planet long ago. The outside of the tubes cooled, forming solid walls, while something hotter inside allowed the remaining have to flow out, forming caves. Question: We can learn from the passage that_. Options: A: water has already been found on Mars B: the scientists found all the caves at night C: it is certain that there is life in these caves D: the surface of Mars is bitterly cold, radiation-soaked and dry\nAns: D\n\nQues: Read the article and select the best answer.

I asked him if he wants to come in as my parents were involved in the late night Sangeet rehearsals. He nodded gently and before I could know, we were cuddling and watching TV. I felt like a rebel, though it was the strangest and least expected thing I had done. Then he kissed me. Before I knew it I let him in my mouth \u2026and he kept rolling his tongue on mine. It was my first kiss, and I don't regret it. The warmth of his mouth, the wetness of his lips and his breath felt like the only thing I ever wanted. I was a teen so please not judge. Sadly\u2026 before we could proceed, rest of our cousins called us to play Antakhshree with them. Never have we met since, but we often exchange messages on Facebook. It will be hard and awkward to attend his marriage. I love him. The author probably believes that: Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. she will never see him again  B. not enough information  C. she will not end up marrying him  D. she will end up marrying him\n(Answer)\nC\n\nQuestion: Not as a nurse, but as a patient. I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly \u201cleaking\u201d blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she\u2019d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn\u2019t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no \u201chard feelings.\u201d Why was the author slowly leaking blood post surgery? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. because they had their appendix removed  B. because the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision  C. because the blood would not drain on its own.

In June 2014, Adelaide had an estimated resident population of 1.31 million. South Australia, with a total of 1.7 million inhabitants, has the most centralised population of any state in Australia, with more than 75 percent of its people living in greater Adelaide, while the other population centres in the state are relatively small.  - \"What a Great Night\" is the third single released by Hilltop Hoods from their 2006 album, \"The Hard Road\". It was released as a CD single and as a 12\" vinyl.  - Australia Day is the official National Day of Australia. Celebrated annually on 26 January, it marks the anniversary of the 1788 arrival of the First Fleet of British Ships at Port Jackson, New South Wales, and the raising of the Flag of Great Britain at Sydney Cove by Governor Arthur Phillip. In present-day Australia, celebrations reflect the diverse society and landscape of the nation, and are marked by community and family events, reflections on Australian history, official community awards, and citizenship ceremonies welcoming new members of the Australian community.  - `` Clown Prince '' is a single released by Australian hip - hop band , the Hilltop Hoods . The single , the first from the 2006 album , The Hard Road , reached # 30 in the ARIA charts , becoming the first Hilltop Hoods song to appear on the ARIA Singles Chart . The song also charted at # 23 on the Triple J Hottest 100 , 2006 list .  - Australian hip hop traces its origins to the early 1980s and is largely inspired by hip hop and other predominantly African-American musical genres from the United States. As the form matured, Australian hip hop has become a commercially viable style of music that is no longer restricted to the creative underground, with artists such as Hilltop Hoods and Bliss n Eso achieving notable fame. Australian hip-hop is still primarily released through independent record labels, which are often owned and operated by the artists themselves. Despite its genesis as an offshoot of American hip hop, Australian hip hop has developed a distinct regional personality that reflects its evolution as an Australian musical style.  - The 2006 Triple J Hottest 100 was announced on Australia Day, 26 January 2007. It is the fourteenth such countdown of the most popular songs of the year, as voted by listeners of the Australian radio station Triple J.  - Hilltop Hoods is an Australian hip hop group that formed in 1994 in Blackwood, Adelaide, South Australia.

Francis) after fellow founder, DJ Next (Ben John Hare), left in 1999. The group released its first extended play, \"Back Once Again\", in 1997 and have subsequently released seven studio albums, two \"restrung\" albums and three DVDs.  - An EP (short for extended play) is a musical recording that contains more tracks than a single, but is usually unqualified as an album or LP. An EP originally referred to specific types of vinyl records other than 78 rpm standard play (SP) and LP, but it is now applied to mid-length CDs and downloads as well.  - Triple J is a government-funded, national Australian radio station intended to appeal to listeners between the ages of 18 and 25 which began broadcasting in January 1975. The station places a greater emphasis on broadcasting Australian and alternative music compared to commercial stations. Triple J is government-owned and is a division of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.  - The J Award is an award given by influential Australian youth radio station Triple J to Australian Album of the Year. It is judged by the music and on-air teams at triple j, Unearthed and Double J. The award was inaugurated in 2005, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the station's establishment.  - Matthew David Lambert (born 6 May 1977), better known by his stage name Suffa, is one of the MCs of the Adelaide, Australia, hip hop group Hilltop Hoods. Suffa is also a producer and has produced tracks for other artists, such as Funkoars and Kate Miller-Heidke, in addition to his work with the Hilltop Hoods. Lambert has been an active artist for over 15 years since the release of the debut Hilltop Hoods album.  - Obese Records was a record label that released music from the Australian hip hop genre.

During the study, volunteers were asked to perform one of two simple tasks during which researchers checked to ask if the participants' minds were wandering. At the end, participants measured their working memory ability by remembering a series of letters with simple maths questions. Daniel, a psychologist in the United States, said that those with higher working memory ability reported \"more mind wandering during these simple tasks\", but their performance did not suffer. The results, published online in the journal Psychological Science, appear to confirm previous research that found working memory allows humans to deal with multiple   thoughts at the same time. Dr Smallwood,in Leipzig,Germany,said: \"What this study seems to suggest is that, when circumstances for the task aren't very difficult, people who have additional working memory resources arrange _ to think about things other than what they're doing. \" Working memory ability is also associated with general measures of intelligence, such as reading comprehension and IQ scores, and also offers a window into the widespread, but not well understood, field of internally   driven thoughts. Dr Smallwood added: \"Our results suggest the sorts of planning that people do quite often in daily life--when they are on the bus, when they are cycling to work, when they are in the shower--are probably supported by working memory.

Shock. People often suffer from shock after receiving an injury, sometimes even when the injury is very tiny. The face turns grey, and the skin becomes damp   and cold. They breathe quickly. They should be kept warm. Cover them with a blanket and give them a warm drink. Broken bones. Do not move the patient. Send for an ambulance at once. Bleeding. A little bleeding doesn't harm. It washes dirt from the wound. But if the bleeding continues, try to stop it by placing a clean cloth firmly over the wound until the bleeding stops or helps arrive. Poison. A person who has taken poison should be taken to a hospital at once. With some poisons, sleeping pills, for example, it is a good thing to make the patient throw up by pressing your fingers down his throat. Remember: When an accident happens, send someone to telephone for an ambulance at once. Keep the injured person warm and quiet. Give him plenty of air. Do not let other people crowd around him.

Yes or no, is the answer \"First Aid\"?\nNo\n\nArticle: Every day it seems that people are coming up with new and innovative ways to use mobile devices like cellphones and smart phones. Researchers at Princeton University are looking for new ways to measure a person's sense of _ with mobile devices. To gain a better understanding of how cellphones and other mobile devices can measure our sense of happiness, the research team conducted a study that was published recently in the journal Demography. To gather data for their study, the team created an application for mobile devices using the Android operating system. Once the app was developed, the researchers invited people to download it and take part in their study. Over a three-week period, the research team was able to collect data from some 270 participants living in 13 countries. Participants came not only from the United States, but also from other nations like Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Over the course of the study, participants received occasional text questions from the researchers that asked \"How happy are you?\". Along with recording their response, the app used the mobile device's built-in GPS to keep track of the participant's location. The study participants were asked to rate their current state of happiness on a scale of zero to five. As they gathered data from the information collected through the application, the researchers then were able to create new methods that could help provide a better understanding of how our surroundings can influence our emotional well-being. The researchers learned that mobile devices can provide an effective way to quickly grab information that, because of today's active lifestyle, can be difficult to record. Being able to quickly grab this information was something the researchers felt was important. They said feelings and emotions that were recorded as they were happening were most likely to be more honest and precise than using other methods like writing down how they felt on a...

Assuming that the atmospheric pressure is standard, the temperature will rise steadily until it reaches 100\u00b0C. At this point, the added energy from the heat will cause the liquid to begin to vaporize. As with the previous state change, the temperature will remain at 100\u00b0C while the water molecules are going from the liquid to the gas or vapor state. Once all the liquid has completely boiled away, continued heating of the steam (remember the container is closed) will increase its temperature above 100\u00b0C.  and the situation: To reenact James Watt's experiment, John sealed some water in a container. He called this stage of his experiment as stage A. Then he started heating the water in the sealed container. He labeled this stage as stage B. Once the temperature reached hundred degree centigrade, he added more heat to it. He called this stage as stage C. Once all the water has turned into steam, he kept adding heat to it.

In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.  and the situation: Us and Canada are two friendly countries.

Article: According to decades-long research, women who took low to moderate  daily doses of aspirin had a reduced death rate, especially from heart disease. The research, based on data from a major trial that has tracked almost 80,000 women since 1976, found that women who reported using aspirin on a regular basis had a 25 percent lower risk of death from any cause than women who didn't take the drug.   The risk of death from cardiovascular  disease was 38 percent lower for aspirin users, and there was also a 12 percent reduction in cancer deaths that took effect after a decade of aspirin use, the researchers found in their report based on the Nurses' Health Study. However, an accompanying editorial in the journal cautioned that the results were open to debate and far from definitive.       The dissenting   editorial was based on results of an earlier trial by the Women's Health Study, which followed almost 40,000 women for 11 years and found no reduction in overall deaths. Therefore, the new findings \"cannot overcome the accumulated evidence that aspirin is not particularly effective for the primary prevention of death from cardiovascular disease in women.\"       \"This is a complicated issue,\" said Dr. Andrew T. Chan, leading author of the new report. \"We understand that aspirin has potential health benefits, but who would aspirin therapy  be appropriate for?\" There are \"areas of disagreement that need further study\" before that question can be answered, Chan said. But there is information from the two large studies and other trials that can help guide women and their physicians, he said. And anyone who is thinking about daily aspirin \"should really talk with doctors about the benefits and risks.\" Question: The new report clearly benefits the women suffering Options: A: heart disease B: cancer C: lose of memory D: aspirin side effects\nA\n\nI'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Massachusetts-based Merriam-Webster Inc. said \"w00t\" reflects a new direction in the American language led by a generation raised on video games and mobile phone text-messaging. It's like saying \"yay,\" the dictionary said. \"It could be after a triumph  or for no reason at all,\" Merriam-Webster said. Visitors to Merriam-Webster's Web site were invited to vote for one of 20 words and phrases selected from the most frequently looked-up words on the site and submitted by readers. Merriam-Webster President John Morse said \"w00t\" reflected the growing use of numeric keyboards to type words. \"People look for self-evident numeral-letter substitutions: 0 for O; 3 for E; 7 for T; and 4 for A,\" he said. \"This is simply a different and more efficient way of representing the alphabetical character.\" Online gamers often replace numbers and symbols with letters to form what Merriam-Webster calls an \"esoteric computer hacker language\" known as \"l33t speak.\" This translates into \"leet,\" which is short for \"elite.\"   One Web site, www.thinkgeek.com, already sells T-shirts with the word \"w00t\" printed on the front. Runner-up was \"facebook\" as a new verb meaning to add someone to a list of friends on the Web site Facebook.com or to search for people on the social networking site.  \"Truthiness\" was the word of last year picked by Webster. A separate survey of words used in the media and on the Internet by California-based Global Language Monitor produced a different set of winners last week. \"Hybrid\" took top honors as word of the year with \"climate change\" the top phrase. Runner-up was \"surge,\" based on the \"surge\" of 30,000 extra U.S. troops deployed to Iraq since mid-June, followed by the word \"Bluetooth,\" a technology used to connect electronic devices via radio waves. \"The English language is becoming more and more a globalized language every year,\" said Global Language Monitor president Paul Payack, noting that this year's list included words also selected from India, Singapore, China and Australia.

Cadet Brian Moreland (Timothy Hutton), an academic junior, meets privately with the academy commandant, retired Brigadier General Harlan Bache (George C. Scott). Bache promotes Moreland to Cadet Major, the paramount rank at BHMA. Bache also reflects on the time when he was a West Point cadet (Moreland's intended college), as well as a graduate of BHMA prior to that, and how he dreads civilian life with his forthcoming retirement. Moreland is congratulated first by his best friend Cadet Captain Alex Dwyer (Sean Penn), as well as his other friends: Cadet Captain David Shawn (Tom Cruise) and Cadet Lieutenant Edward West (Evan Handler). Shawn leads a celebration in the hallway. The commencement is celebrated by a parade and pass and review. Following the ceremonies, General Bache announces that BHMA's board of trustees is selling the school to real estate developers; however, they will remain open for one more year in order to allow the seniors to graduate and give the underclassmen time to apply to other schools. The delay gives many cadets hope that BHMA - which many of them consider home - can be saved. Bache also expresses his hope that the institute can be saved, as he wryly remarks to Moreland \"We are here, and the condos are not\". The graduation ceremony is also honored with a ball that evening. Outside the gates, a brawl erupts when several \"townies\" (local teenagers) harass the cadets, which escalates into one local actually assaulting a sentry. General Bache sees this and tries to play peacemaker by breaking up the fighting boys, however his service pistol is seized by one of the townies. During their scuffle, the weapon discharges - killing a second townie. Although the magazine was removed, a round was still in the chamber.

Movie title: Lanka Context: Lanka is a modern take on the Ramayana with Sita's life being saved by Vibhishan (Raavan's brother) from Raavan. The movie \"Lanka\" begins in the present day Mumbai with Anju (Tia Bajpai) narrating about her past. Jaswant Sisodia (Manoj Bajpayee) is the don of a small town in UP, India called Bijnor. He rules the place and the police and politicians support him. He is in love with Anju, a doctor. Her father (Yatin Karyekar) is the Chief Medical Officer of Bijnor. Anju is actually sexually exploited by Sisodia. Every night after taking drinks, he comes to her house and sleeps with her. She tries to commit suicide but her father stops her.

Media junk Product review: It seems like the greed of the movie studios strikes again. In their constant attempts to stem piracy they have made the movie inaccessible on a PC. I can watch the movie on a DVD player, but cannot watch it on my PC. I will not buy a product that will not allow me to play it on the player of my choice. I take DVDs with me to watch in hotels when I am out of town. This is one that eliminates that possibility.When are these idiot going to realize that many of these pirated copies were never going to be sales to begin with? For free they take. For \"buy\", don't bother. Every pirate copy also exposes the movie and may actually turn it into a sale. But in this case, the revenue they believe they gained they have lost because I will not buy products with this draconian scheme that limits my playback options.

This is OK, but frustrating, for some things like ISO and white balance, but it makes the exposure compensation wheel useless. It only moves in the negative direction and once it reaches -2, it is stuck there and will not come back up. This is true whether using the control wheel on the camera or the one on the grip.

The latter have their own explanation; Katahdin, a vengeful spirit of the forest that has been awakened by the activities of the loggers, which Isely describes as \"larger than a dragon with the eyes of a cat\". As Isely drives the couple to their cabin, their path is barred by a party of Opies who refuse to let Isely's people pass and a fight ensues between the leader of the Opies John Hawks (Armand Assante) and Kelso (Everett Creach), one of Isely's heavies.

Brijit, Brosowsky said, aims to be \"everyone's best-read friend.\"\n\nNow on Brijit are summations of articles in current issues of GQ, Wired, Mother Jones, ESPN the Magazine, the Economist, Smithsonian and more than 50 other magazines. Even if you never read the entire article, just scanning Brijit could make you the smartest person at your next cocktail party.\n\nBut the Internet is littered with good ideas that turn out to be bad businesses, and online publishing can be especially tricky: Do you go mass-market or niche? Subscription-based, or free and ad-supported? Original content or aggregation of other content?\n\nFurther, at just 34, Brosowsky already has one failed publishing venture under his belt.\n\nBut Brosowsky's latest idea is attracting interest and nearly $1 million in venture capital from about 10 investors, including Norman Pearlstine, former editor of Time magazine and now with Carlyle Group.\n\nBrosowsky's inspiration came in part from being a father of two children with twins on the way. He said he tries to be an avid reader, but the many demands on his time have led to the creation of his own pile of unread, paid-for magazines.\n\n\"I wished there was someone who would tell me the five stories in that pile I have to read,\" Brosowsky said.\n\nThere are precedents for the idea. Reader's Digest became America's most popular magazine for decades by condensing content to short, easily readable articles. And magazine analyst Mark Edmiston notes that \"The Week,\" the National Review's weekly magazine summary of news, written with attitude and wit, has made a solid business.\n\n\"I think [Brijit] makes a lot of sense,\" Edmiston said. \"I think that's where the Web is going.\"\n\nThe Web is moving toward the combination of human reviewers with Internet search. WebMD founder Jeff Arnold has said that if the latest evolution of the Internet, Web 2.0, was about the consumer -- meaning user-generated sites such as MySpace, Facebook and YouTube -- then Web 3.0 will be about the editor.\nWhat are the most important parts of this text?\n\nA:"}], "response": "The magazines stack up, unread, on your coffee table: the New Yorker, Atlantic Monthly, Sports Illustrated, Vanity Fair.

Is this village truly haunted, or is it something else more sinister? It is up to Hamish, but not so much as to draw attention to his heroics - because then he might get promoted.Hamish wants to stay in Lochdubh with his dog, Lugs. He definitely does not want to be promoted in any way.How he does solve the mystery of Stoyre, and how he gets non-promoted makes for a delightful book for all Hamish MacBeth. A great light read!

I never found it to be good for toast as it took forever and toasted unevenly. But it came in handy now and then. However, two days ago I went to make some bagel pizzas for the kids and while the tick tick of the timer sounded, nothing else worked properly. I tried several outlets. Wasn't the issue. No lights and no heat.I usually read reviews before buying appliances. Either this was so new that the reviews weren't out yet or I bought on impulse. Either way, I'm disappointed. We've had this maybe 2 years...??I think I'll be checking out another brand for the next toaster oven.

Wobei mir das \u00fcberhaupt nicht auf den Magen schl\u00e4gt, der Gesamtsound ist wunderbar und vorantreibend. Auch die Gitarren leisten Spitzenarbeit ab.

Es kommen sogar mal kurz cleane Vocals zum Einsatz. Aber diese werden nicht tragend f\u00fcr das Lied eingesetzt, also keine Sorge. Weiterhin regieren die tiefen Shouts aus Dez's Kehle.  Ansonsten bleibt nur noch zu sagen, dass auch die Produktion auf ganzer Linie \u00fcberzeugen kann. Einfach nur fett.  Also, Devildriver Fans werden sicher nicht entt\u00e4uscht sein.

The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.  and the situation: Russian research spent most of their time in Antarctica to study the loss of ozone in the atmosphere. The Canadian team went north of the Polar Circle, close to the North Pole to do the same thing. They spent several months there. The Canadian team didn't find any ozone holes at the North Pole.  Answer the following question: Which team was less exposed to eye cataracts?\nAnswer: Canadian\n\nQuestion: Given the background: Using longitudinal data from over 100 countries, Diener and his colleagues showed that rich countries are in general happier than poor countries (Diener, Tay, & Oishi, 2013).[17] Also, life satisfaction for most countries goes up as they become wealthier over time. Diener identified three factors that influence the relationship between income and SWB. Namely, rising income most likely results in higher SWB when it leads to greater optimism, financial satisfaction and household material prosperity among citizens. Furthermore, Diener and his colleagues investigated the relationship between income and different elements of SWB. They illustrated that income has stronger influence on people\u2019s evaluation of their lives than the positive or negative emotions they experience over time (Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010).[18] The study points to the necessity to evaluate different elements of SWB separately instead of treating happiness as a single entity.  and the situation: Two neighboring countries implemented different sets of economic reforms. The reforms took over a decade to implement, but the effects were not similar at all. Redvania was more prosperous and it became much richer, while Blueland stagflated and the inhabitants were not pleased with the outcome.  Answer the following question: Which country was much happier after 10 years?\nAnswer: Redvania\n\nQuestion: Given the background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them \u2013 just as no-till \u2013 categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.  and the situation: Barb and Jill practiced small scale farming. Jill farmed the conventional way, while barb used the no-tillage method.  Answer the following question: Which farmer didn't have soil which may delay planting to less ideal dates?\nAnswer:"}], "response": "Jill"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "a powerful earthquake struck islands in western greece on thursday , sending panicked residents and tourists into the streets and causing some injuries and damage , officials said .\n\nA summary about the text above: powerful quake hits western greek island\n\nthe congressional blue dogs and hundreds of their allies were penned up inside an oceanfront amusement park on famous santa monica pier sunday night , hounded by protesters trying to disrupt events at the democratic national convention .\n\nA summary about the text above: for the blue dogs convention provides a night to howl\n\nr. allen stanford , the texas financier accused of defrauding tens of thousands of bank depositors , said monday that he was not a thief .\n\nA summary about the text above: besieged financier emerges defiantly accusing others\n\nchina thursday offered belated congratulations to japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi on his election win , but warned that his visits to a notorious tokyo war shrine remained a problem .\n\nA summary about the text above:"}], "response": "china congratulates koizumi on poll win"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "input question: Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package org.telegram.messenger.???\noutput answer: Useful I like it because of free call and message good feature\n\ninput question: Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms.???\noutput answer: Aman Cool\n\ninput question: Generate a 1-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms.???\noutput answer: It sucks\n\ninput question: Generate a 1-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.marvin.talkback.???\noutput answer:"}], "response": "Keeps installing in my phone.

It made it seem like Easter was this big national holiday we were all supposed to be celebrating.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s so much more to celebrate. Sure, some of the latest holidays exist purely in the confines of the cloud. No reasonable person is going to grab the nearest vegan because of Hug a Vegetarian Day. But other \u201cmicroholidays\u201d or hashtag holidays have crossed over into the real world.\n\nSusan McPherson, 51, a corporate responsibility consultant, was invited last year for the first time to a pie party in observation of Pi Day. \u201cThere were tons of pies,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, I posted a picture; the pies were so beautiful.\u201d\n\nWhether they originated as public relations opportunities or alleviators of boredom, these gratuitous celebrations can stir some of the same emotions the old stalwarts do. And just like traditional holidays, the new ones can manage to make you feel full and empty at the same time. \u201cHolidays online can be a wonderful way to feel like you\u2019re not alone in the world,\u201d Ms. McPherson said. \u201cBut it can also make you feel like the loneliest person in the world.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, social media celebrations can be a boon to the lonesome. \u201cHolidays online are a way for me to take the air out of how lonely it can be,\u201d said Tim Federle, an author and co-writer of the Broadway musical \u201cTuck Everlasting.\u201d \u201cOne Valentine\u2019s Day, I saw a heart-shaped balloon sticking out of a garbage can, and I took a photo and posted it on Facebook with the caption \u2018Too soon!\u2019 It got so many likes, it really bolstered me.\u201d\n\nThat commiseration now takes place in real time. \u201cIt used to be that at some point during holiday festivities, everyone would sneak off and go online and ask, \u2018Hey is anyone else there?\u2019\u201d said Clay Shirky, a global network professor at New York University and author of \u201cHere Comes Everybody.\u201d \u201cAnd it turned out everyone was there. People were done with their families, and had moved on to their adoptive families online. Only now, we don\u2019t have to wait or sneak away any more.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr. Shirky, the Internet has a long tradition of embracing minor holidays, starting with April Fools\u2019 Day when, in 1984, a group of Usenet regulars posted a hoax called \u201cKremvax,\u201d in which the Russians supposedly sent a message from the Kremlin. Since then, holidays have been marked globally as they roll through successive time zones, and meta-holidays like Thanksgiving Clapback (people tweet out their holiday complaints) have blossomed based on existing ones.\n\nIn some cases, offline holidays have migrated into the ether. Andrea Schneider, a director of product management at the Internal Revenue Service who lives in Bethesda, Md., recently started observing Rosh Hashana online. She, her husband and their two children curl up on the sofa and stream a service they like at a synagogue in Ohio. \u201cAt services around here, I always felt a little lonely without my entire extended family,\u201d Ms. Schneider said. \u201cWatching online with my kids, I feel like I get back some of the feeling of togetherness I was looking for.\u201d Friends of hers have set up a Google Hangout where they light Sabbath candles together.\n\nOn the Internet, all are included: distant relatives and friends, elderly aunts and sick grandparents can be virtually drawn into a physical gathering they may otherwise miss. This used to happen post facto, when photographs were mailed; now celebrants keep cellphones by their side throughout dinner, posting images as they eat. But it can take away some of the intimacy and informality.\n\n\u201cA 22-year-old woman complained to me that she used to love coming home for the holidays,\u201d said Sherry Turkle, author of \u201cReclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age.\u201d Once her mother started posting all the photos online, she missed the privacy. \u201cBefore, she could relax and be a child again, but now she feels like she has to put on makeup and be on her best behavior. What was once a private affair is now a quasi-public event.\u201d\n\nJen Nedeau, director of strategic communications at Bully Pulpit Interactive, said, \u201cSocial media brings us to a community table where we get to experience holidays in the same room.\u201d As she sees it, social media functions the way Hallmark used to, helping us figure out which holidays matter to us, and fostering communities that mimic the experience of small towns where everyone can digitally laugh together at what Grandma just said.\n\nThis all feels so \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d it\u2019s hard to sound a curmudgeonly note. I\u2019ve tried to be more festive in April, National Poetry Month, posting several odes to verse. On National Siblings Day (April 10), while everyone else displayed sweet childhood photos of sisters hugging, I went gung-ho on Twitter: \u201cWhen I was a child, my older brother would pin me down and let long tentacles of saliva dangle menacingly in my face. #HappySiblingsDay.\u201d A bunch of total strangers favorited it, and I felt good.\nPlease write a summary below.\nPrivate rituals are now public.

Circle Drive is cosigned as Highway 11 and Highway 16 for its entire length.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - Hudson Bay Park is geographically located in north west Saskatoon just south of Circle Drive along 33rd Street and Avenue P North .

This resolution marked the earliest attempt to establish a Canadian government policy requesting the sovereign not to grant knighthoods, baronetcies, and peerages to Canadians and set the precedent for later policies restricting Canadians from accepting titles from foreign countries. Dissatisfaction with the British honours system led to the gradual creation of a separate system for Canada.  - Statistics Canada, which was formed in 1971, is the Government of Canada government agency commissioned with producing statistics to help better understand Canada, its population, resources, economy, society, and culture.

Movie title: Gorillas in the Mist: The Story of Dian Fossey Movie plot: Occupational therapist Dian Fossey (Sigourney Weaver) is inspired by the anthropologist Louis Leakey (Iain Cuthbertson) to devote her life to the study of primates. To this end, she writes ceaselessly to him for a job cataloguing and studying the rare mountain gorillas of Africa. With some effort, she manages to convince Leakey of her conviction and devotion to the cause at hand after personally approaching him following a lecture in Louisville, Kentucky, on his part in 1966. Thereafter, Fossey embarks into the Congo, where Leakey and his foundation equip her with the necessary equipment and housing to achieve personal contact with the gorillas, and introduce her to a local animal tracker, Sembagare (John Omirah Miluwi), to assist her in her endeavors. Settling deep in the jungle, Fossey and Sembagare manage to locate a troop of gorillas, but they are ultimately displaced by the events of the Congo Crisis after being forcibly evicted from their research site by Congolese soldiers, who accuse Fossey of being a foreign spy and agitator. Initially, Fossey sees no other option but to leave the continent and return to the United States. However, after Sembagare and her temporary host Rosamond Carr (Julie Harris) motivate her to stay, she decides to base her research efforts in the jungles of neighboring Rwanda, which Dian presumes will be safe from outside incursions. However, what Fossey fails to foresee are the rampant problems of poaching and corruption taking place therein, which become apparent when she discovers several traps in the vicinity of her new base at Karisoke. Nevertheless, Fossey and her colleagues make several key headways with the gorillas, taking account of the gorilla's communication and social groups. In so doing, her work impresses Leakey and gains broader international attention. National Geographic, which funds her efforts, takes an increasingly marked interest in her work and dispatches photographer Bob Campbell (Bryan Brown) to highlight her research.

Movie plot: By the year 3028 A.D., deep space travel and interaction with a plethora of alien races is commonplace for humanity and, as often happens with the passage of time, a new discovery is made. As electricity and splitting the atom were in history, what comes to be known as the Titan Project proves to be a profound scientific advance in mankind's role in the universe; a testament to their strength and imagination. However, it is explained that this marvel does not go unnoticed. The Drej, an alien race comprised entirely of energy, deems the human race a threat and advance their armada on Earth to destroy the Titan Project and what they see as mankind's last chance of being a dominant force in the galaxy.Five year-old Cale (Alex D. Linz) puts the last touches on his latest invention, a hydro-powered console, before it accidentally breaks in a small creek. His father, Sam Tucker (Ron Perlman) comes to collect him, explaining that they have to leave. He takes his son to the nearby base where he is stationed and where evacuation pods filled with people are being sent into space. Sam places Cale in the care of family friend and guardian Tek (Tone Loc) before explaining that he has to go away for a while. He gives Cale a gold ring and tells him that, as long as he wears it, there will be hope. Then, despite Cale's pleas, Sam is escorted by friend Joseph Korso (Bill Pullman) to a nearby hangar as Cale is brought aboard an evacuation pod with Tek. Reports of Drej fighters attacking civilian pods ring out as Cale's ship takes off. He watches as his father runs inside and activates the Titan Project; a large, spherical ship which manages to fly past the incoming Drej and uses its hyperdrive to vanish into outer space. At a safe distance, Cale watches as the Drej mothership, commanded by the Queen Drej (Christopher Scarabosio), hones in on Earth and destroys it in one shot with a massive energy blast.Fifteen years later, Cale (Christopher Scarabosio) works in a salvage yard in asteroid belt Tau 14.

Elvis arrives at the church of Pastor David Sandow (William Hurt). He watches his sermon from the back of the church and then follows him and his family, including his wife Twyla (Laura Harring), son Paul (Paul Dano) and daughter Malerie (Pell James), to their home. Pastor Sandow confronts Elvis, who shows him a snapshot of his mother Yolanda, with whom he had relations many years ago before becoming a Christian. Pastor Sandow becomes agitated and tells Elvis that he has a family now and is a popular member of the community. He tells Elvis to call him so they can talk, though later tells his family that the young man simply wanted to become a member of the church and to not associate with him. Elvis moves in to a local motel and gets a job as a pizza delivery man. Having met Pastor Sandow's teenage daughter Malerie earlier at the church, he soon begins to pick her up from school where they go on drives and take walks at a local park. They start a passionate affair and have sexual relations on a regular basis. Meanwhile, Pastor Sandow's son Paul leads a high school movement where he attempts to change the school's science curriculum from evolution to intelligent design, though his plans are rejected by the school board. Disappointed by this setback, Paul, who leads a Christian rock band at his father's church, performs an intimate song before the congregation about his frustrations, the song being a cover of Sparklehorse's \"Sad and Beautiful World\". Pastor Sandow severely chastises his son for such indulgence. One evening, Elvis sneaks into the Sandow's home to spend the night with Malerie. After they have sex, he leaves the house in the middle of night and is spotted by Paul. He follows Elvis back to his motel and interrogates him about his affair with his sister.

He acts immediately to save the man's life by giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Later, at home, Moran sits studying a drawing obviously made by a child. The incident that day has reminded him of a time in the summer of 1958 when he failed to act to save a life. The rest of the film proceeds as a flashback.Teenage David Moran (Daniel Manche) is down catching crawfish at the local stream when he runs into the new girl in town, 16 year-old Megan Loughin (Blythe Auffarth). Megan and her little sister, ten year-old Susan (Madeline Taylor), have just moved in with David's next door neighbor, divorcee Ruth Chandler (Blanche Baker) and her three sons. Meg and Susan have recently been orphaned after a car accident that left Susan crippled.The Chandler household is a big teenage hangout in the neighborhood. Mrs. Chandler (who the kids call \"Ruth\") is considered a cool parent as she secretly lets the kids drink beer and plies the boys with salacious talk.When David runs into Megan a couple days later she tells him that nothing she does seems to please Ruth. David has an idea to make peace between them: he suggests that Megan draw a picture for Ruth. Meg does not want to do this as she is afraid that Ruth with ridicule her. David suggests instead that Megan draw one for him.

O'Niel (Sean Connery), is assigned to a one-year tour of duty at Con Am 27, a titanium ore mining outpost on Jupiter's third moon Io (pronounced \"eye-oh\"), a volcanic moon about 2,275 miles in diameter and located 275,000 miles from Jupiter's gas surface. Conditions on Io are difficult - gravity is 1/6th that of Earth with no breathable atmosphere, atmospheric work-suits are cumbersome, and miners carry around their own air supply whilst working. Shifts are long but significant bonuses are paid as incentives to boost production. Explaining in an opening disclaimer, Con Am 27 is franchised to Con-Amalgamate by the League of Industrial Nations located on Earth. The colony's population is 2,144 men and women (1,250 labor, 714 support personnel, and 180 administration and maintenance crew). It is policed by a forced called Administrative Level 4 and above.Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle), the head of the mining colony, boasts that since he took over the running of Io productivity has broken all previous records.The film begins with a miner named Tarlow (John Ratzenberger) suffering an attack of the DT's who rips open his work-suit which then decompresses resulting in his death. Shortly thereafter another miner Cane (Eugene Lipinski) enters a lift to the mine without wearing his work-suit, and likewise dies from decompression.With the assistance of Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), O'Niel starts an investigation into these deaths. However, before he can complete his investigation there is a further incident, this time involving a worker Sagan (Steven Berkoff) threatening to kill a prostitute with a knife. At the scene of this incident O'Niel attempts to calm the man and enter the room by the main door, whilst Montone, O'Niel's sergeant (James B. Sikking), enters the room via the air duct.

Movie title: Mother Movie plot: An unnamed widow lives alone with her only son, selling medicinal herbs in a small town in southern South Korea while doing unlicensed acupuncture to the town's women on the side. Her son Do-joon is shy, but prone to attack anyone who mocks his intellectual disability. She dotes on him and scolds him for hanging out with Jin-tae, a local ne'er-do-well. A high school girl is discovered dead on a rooftop in town, shocking the residents and pressuring the incompetent police to find the killer. With only circumstantial evidence placing Do-joon near the scene of the crime, the police are happy with their cursory investigation and arrest the boy. His defense attorney is unreliable, and the police trick Do-joon into signing a confession, leaving him facing a long jail sentence. The police could not figure out why and who would display the girl's dead body on the rooftop where the entire town is in plain view. The mother, horrified and unconvinced that Do-joon is even capable of murder, gets involved in unraveling the details of the murder and the background of the victim to try to prove her son's innocence. She scours the town, uncovering salacious details of the girl's life, allying with Jin-tae, who is surprisingly sympathetic towards her plight, and unsettling everyone around her in her determined quest for justice.\n++++++++++\noutput:"}], "response": "Jin-tae"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a movie review.\na monster \nQ: Write a negative (OPTIONS:\n- negative\n- positive) movie review.\n\nA: one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . \nproblem: Generate a short movie review that has positive sentiment.\ngenerated: as good as the full monty , but a really strong second effort . \ninput: Generate a short movie review that has \"positive\" sentiment\nOPTIONS:\n- negative\n- positive.\n\noutput: things interesting \nWrite a movie review.\nthat it stinks \nWrite a movie review.\n"}], "response": "comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly "}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is the premise \"Two women with aprons are dipping slices of bread in mixture and putting them on a pot while another one looks at the process.\" true if \"Women cooking together.\"?\nOPTIONS:\n- yes\n- it is not possible to tell\n- no\nyes\nQ: \"A blond boy wearing a blue life vest and camo shorts jumps off a diveboard into a blue lake.\" Does this mean that \"Water from the dive splashes on his brother.\"?

Article: People usually hate mice, but one mouse has won the hearts of the people all over the world---the famous Mickey Mouse. Fifty years ago most movies were silent. A man called Walt Disney made a cartoon mouse that could talk his movies. He named his mouse Mickey Mouse. People, both young and old, were very excited at the talking mouse. Children loved to see their friend, because he brought joy and laughter to them. Mickey was a clean mouse right from the beginning. Perhaps this is one reason why people hate real mice and love Mickey Mouse. In his early life Mickey made some mistakes. People were angry. They wrote to Disney and said that they did not want Mickey to do silly things. So Disney made a new animal named Donald Duck. He also made a dog called Pluto.

Article: Do you like to eat sushi ? Many people are afraid to eat it, because they think the bacteria  in it might make them sick. However, a new study shows that sea bacteria are good for people. The study finds that a special enzyme  from sea bacteria is helpful to humans. It helps people to get more energy from food. To people's surprise, the enzyme is present only in the Japanese. The Japanese traditionally like to eat food rich in seaweed . And the seaweed is rich in this kind of enzyme. However, the enzyme isn't present in all the Japanese. During the study, just 5 out of 14 Japanese had the enzyme. All the Americans studied didn't have the enzyme. \"The number is small,\" said researcher Mirjam Czjzek. \"But we can say that this enzyme is present only in the Japanese and not in the North Americans.\" Then some people think that maybe other people are able to get the enzyme if they eat a lot of seaweed. The study suggests that they collect uncooked seaweed to make their sushi. Restaurant sushi is often cooked, which will destroy the enzyme. So, if you want to get that enzyme, you can travel to Japan to have a taste of the real sushi. Question: Sea bacteria are   _   for people.

Article: Have you ever noticed how busy our roads are becoming? Every year more and more cars are using them. Already in such countries as America, almost every family has a car. Many accidents happen because cars are now made to travel very fast. Also, people waste time and money every day as long lines of cars move slowly into towns and cities. In most big towns it is very hard to find parking spaces. Wide, smooth  , straight   roads must be built now in place of the old and narrow roads. These roads must not pass through towns and cities. They must not be crossed by other roads. Today such roads are being built  in many countries in the world. These roads have at least two lanes , one for slow-moving traffic and the other for fast-moving traffic. These roads do not pass through town and cities; horses and bikes are not allowed on them. Accidents do not usually happen. Cars can travel hundreds of miles without having to stop. But these modem roads often cannot be built in towns and cities. Before a road in a town can be made wider, many buildings have to be pulled down. Some people feel that more car-parks should be built outside a city, then the drivers should leave their cars and catch a bus or take a taxi to their offices.

It's over a hundred years old. In the winter of 1891, a certain college was having some trouble with its boy students. The weather was bad and the students had to stay indoors. As they couldn't play outdoors, they were unhappy, and some even got into fights from time to time. Some of the teachers, at the college asked Dr. Naismith to invent a game so that the students might have something to play with. It was not easy to invent such a game because it had to be played indoors , and the court   was not very large. Dr. Naismith thought for a few days and invented a kind of ball game. It was a fast, wonderful game with much moving and passing of the ball. It was played between two teams. To make a score , the ball had to be thrown into the basket ten feet  above the floor on the wall . At each end of the court there was such a basket. At first, Dr. Naismith wanted to throw the ball into a box. As he could not find boxes of the right size, he had to use fruit baskets instead. That is how the game got its name.

As life in Paris returned to normal, in June 1871, Bizet's appointment as chorus-master at The Op\u00e9ra was seemingly confirmed by its director, \u00c9mile Perrin. Bizet was due to begin his duties in October, but on 1 November, the post was assumed by Hector Salomon. In her biography of Bizet, Mina Curtiss surmises that he either resigned or refused to take up the position as a protest against what he thought was the director's unjustified closing of Ernest Reyer's opera Erostrate after only two performances. Bizet resumed work on Clarissa Harlowe and Gris\u00e9lidis, but plans for the latter to be staged at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique fell through, and neither work was finished; only fragments of their music survive. Bizet's other completed works in 1871 were the piano duet entitled Jeux d'enfants, and a one-act opera, Djamileh, which opened at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in May 1872. It was poorly staged and incompetently sung; at one point the leading singer missed 32 bars of music. It closed after 11 performances, not to be heard again until 1938. On 10 July Genevi\u00e8ve gave birth to the couple's only child, a son, Jacques. Bizet's next major assignment came from Carvalho, who was now managing Paris' Vaudeville theatre and wanted incidental music for Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arl\u00e9sienne. When the play opened on 1 October, the music was dismissed by critics as too complex for popular taste. However, encouraged by Reyer and Massenet, Bizet fashioned a four-movement suite from the music, which was performed under Pasdeloup on 10 November to an enthusiastic reception. In the winter of 1872\u201373, Bizet supervised preparations for a revival of the still-absent Gounod's Rom\u00e9o et Juliette at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. Relations between the two had been cool for some years, but Bizet responded positively to his former mentor's request for help, writing: \"You were the beginning of my life as an artist. I spring from you\".In June 1872, Bizet informed Galabert: \"I have just been ordered to compose three acts for the Op\u00e9ra-Comique.

One of Bob's colleagues has just written an article about Dr. Helen Gurley Brown, a young psychologist and author of the best-selling book Sex and the Single Girl, a self-help guide with advice to single women on how to deal with men. The article raises doubts on her experience with sex and relationships. Helen is very offended, having lost six appointments with patients due to the article discrediting her as a \"23 year-old virgin.\". Bob wants to follow up by interviewing her, but she refuses. Bob's friend and neighbor, stocking manufacturer Frank Broderick, is having marriage issues with his strong-willed wife Sylvia, but can't find the time to go to a counselor. Therefore, Bob decides to impersonate Frank and go to Helen as a patient, with the goal of getting close to her in order to gather more information. In exchange, he'll report back to Frank her advice. During their first couple of sessions, Bob acts shy and smitten, and tries to gently seduce Helen. She seems to respond to Bob's courteous advances, all while insisting it's a transfer and that she'll play the role of Sylvia to the benefit of his therapy. After he fakes a suicide attempt, the two of them end up making out in her apartment, with Bob realizing he's actually falling for Helen, which is the reason he still has not written anything about her, prompting an ultimatum from his boss.\nAnswer: Dr. Helen Gurley Brown\nThe following article contains an answer for the question: Who gets blown up by Harry's grenade? , can you please find it?

To penetrate the barrier and reach the magma below, they intend to detonate an atomic device at the bottom of the hole. The leader of the project, Dr. Stephen Sorenson (Dana Andrews), who is secretly dying of cancer, believes that the atomic device will burn its way through the barrier, but the project's chief geologist, Dr. Ted Rampion (Kieron Moore), is convinced that the lower layers of the crust have been weakened by decades of underground nuclear tests, and that the detonation could produce a massive crack that would threaten the very existence of Earth. The atomic device is used and Rampion's fears prove justified, as the crust of the Earth develops an enormous crack that progresses rapidly. Sorenson discovers that there was a huge reservoir of hydrogen underground, which turned the small conventional atomic explosion into a huge thermonuclear one that was millions of times more powerful. Another atomic device is used in the hope of stopping the crack, but it only reverses the crack's direction. Eventually the crack returns to its starting point at the test site, and a huge chunk of the planet outlined by the crack is expected to be thrown out into space.

The cast includes Ben Foster (also in The Messenger), Robin Wright, Sigourney Weaver, Steve Buscemi and Ice Cube.Although based on a real LAPD scandal from the nineties, Rampart easily transcends reportage.Cameron Bailey, Co-Director of the Toronto International Film Festival???\noutput answer: How are the mothers of Browns children related?\n\n\n[Q]: Generate a question about the following movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Several months after the events of The Fly, Veronica Quaife delivers Seth Brundle's child. After giving birth to a squirming larval sac, she dies from shock. The sac then splits open to reveal a seemingly normal baby boy. The child, named Martin Brundle, is raised by Anton Bartok, owner of Bartok Industries (the company which financed Brundle's teleportation experiments). Fully aware of the accident which genetically merged Seth Brundle with a housefly (a condition that Martin has inherited), Bartok plans to exploit the child's unique condition. Martin grows up in a clinical environment, and is constantly subjected to studies and tests by scientists. His physical and mental maturity is highly accelerated, and he possesses a genius-level intellect, incredible reflexes, and no need for sleep. He knows he is aging faster than a normal human, but is unaware of the true cause, having been told his father died from the same rapid aging disease. As Martin grows, Bartok befriends him. At age 3, Martin has the physique of a 10-year-old, and frequently sneaks around and explores the Bartok complex. He finds a room containing laboratory animals, and befriends a Golden Retriever. The next night, he brings the dog some of his dinner, only to find it missing. He enters an observation booth overlooking Bay 17. There, scientists have managed to reassemble Brundle's Telepods, but were unable to duplicate his programming that enabled them to teleport living subjects. Using the Golden Retriever as a test subject, the experiment fails, leaving the dog horribly deformed. The dog attacks and maims one of the scientists, horrifying young Martin. Two years later, Martin's body has matured to that of a 25-year-old. On his fifth birthday, Bartok presents Martin with a bungalow on the Bartok facility's property.

When caught, the children said they had done what they'd seen on TV. The incidents make people angry who believe that American children are harmed by watching too much TV. They claim children can't tell between the fiction of TV and reality, and TV distracts them from learning and makes them violent. To estimate the impact of TV on young people, \"Life\" magazine hires a company to interview hundreds of school children in Nora Springs, Iowa and in Dallas, Texas. Although the two cities are very different, the company finds children in each city watch the same TV shows. Many Iowa children, who watch an average of three hours of TV a day, recognizing that life on TV is rosier than what they experience. Their favourite shows are situation comedies about American families in trouble. Many boys like violent shows about police detectives or heroes, girls particularly soap operas-stories about families and friends. On the whole, children find real violence on news programs hard to take. \"If you see a bus crash on the news, it's frightening,\" one fifth grader says. By and large, the Iowa children agree that the best thing about TV is it makes you laugh. Children in Dallas are savvier about programs of drug use on TV. \"They don't really show them doing it right. On TV they are not real.\" A fifth grader says. \"Life\" agrees with a 1988 study by the U. S Department of education that finds children are none the worse for watching TV. The study finds TV doesn't have lasting effect on children. On the contrary, kids show good judgment about what they watch. \"There are very few good shows on TV anymore,\" a 10-year-old boy says. While the debate about TV is so heated, the \"Life\" survey gives hope that American kids aren't wasting three or four hours a day (what is worse, by the time young people enter college today, they will have devoted more time to watching television than they will spend in college).

This place seemed to be the smallest.  I didn't wander around a lot or hit the ladies room here, so maybe it was bigger than it looked, but from what I could see this place was super tiny.  It was all white and the tables looked kind of like cabanas up above and around the dance floor.  It was weird, or maybe I was just drunk by this point.

Dans sa travers\u00e9e des Etats Unis, Pee Wee rencontre tout un tas de personnages attachants, des exclus, des marginaux, des minables, et lui non seulement il ne les rejette pas mais il va vers eux, il les aide et leur redonne espoir. Certaines sc\u00e8nes sont extraordinaires, comme celle o\u00f9 Pee Wee sauve sa peau en dansant sur la chanson \"T\u00e9quilla\", d'autres sc\u00e8nes sont des purs moments de po\u00e9sie. C'est en plus un film francophile, ce qui est assez rare dans la production am\u00e9ricaine : on y voit un poster de Bernard Hinault, une serveuse qui r\u00eave de vivre le grand amour \u00e0 Paris, un b\u00e9ret basque, une DS Citro\u00ebn et le film commence par l'arriv\u00e9e du tour de France cycliste \u00e0 Paris !!!

The story takes place in the decaying city of London, the capital of the territory of Airstrip One (formerly Great Britain). Winston is just another lowly Politcal Party official in the Ministry of Propaganda. He lives in a small, dirty flat, and works in a small office cubicle alongside dozens of other men and women at the Ministry of Truth, rewriting history in accordance with the dictates of the Party and its (probably mythical) supreme figurehead, Big Brother (Bob Flag), a Joseph Stalin--esq leader who is never seen in public and whom appears only on propaganda posters, advertising billboards, and television monitors. Winson's task, like many in his office, is to \"erase\" anyone who has fallen afoul of the government from the official histories whom becomes \"unpersons\". Automaton-like, he goes through his daily routine, under constant surveillance from the \"telescreens\" (two-way TV monitors) and his fellow citizens. Winston occasionally attends public rallys at Victory Square where the citizens are shown propoganda films of the current war situation as well as contraditing and false news stories about Oceana's war effort to unite the civilized world under the rule of Big Brother.While his co-worker and neighbor, Parsons (Gregor Fisher), seems content to follow the state's laws, Winston, haunted by painful childhood memories and restless carnal desires, keeps a secret diary of his private thoughts, thus committing thoughtcrime: the crime of independent thought either contrary or superfluous to the aims of the Party.

The Inventor's final result was a humanlike young boy who had everything except for hands, but the Inventor suffered a heart attack and died while in the act of giving a pair of real hands to Edward, leaving him \"unfinished\" forever.Many years after Edward was created, local Avon saleswoman Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest) visits the decrepit Gothic mansion on the hill where Edward lives. There, she finds Edward alone, and upon realizing he is virtually harmless she decides to take him to her home. Edward becomes friends with Peg's young son Kevin (Robert Oliveri) and her husband Bill (Alan Arkin). He later falls in love with the Boggs' beautiful teenage daughter, Kim (Winona Ryder), despite her initial fear of him.Peg's neighbors are impressed by Edward's adept hedge-trimming and hair-cutting skills (both of which he does with his scissor-hands), but two of the townspeople, a religious fanatic named Esmeralda (O-Lan Jones) and Kim's boyfriend, Jim (Anthony Michael Hall), are not impressed. One of the housewives in the neighborhood, Joyce (Kathy Baker), an ageing seductress, suggests that Edward opens a hair-cutting salon with her. While examining a proposed site, she attempts to seduce him in the back room, causing Edward to leave in a state of panic.Wanting money for a van, Jim takes advantage of Edward's ability to pick locks, and uses this as an attempt to break into his parents' house. The burglar alarm sounds and everyone except Edward flees, despite Kim's angry insistence that they return for him. Edward is arrested, but is released when a psychological examination reveals that his isolation allowed him to live without a sense of reality and common sense. At the same time, the arresting officer befriends him.

If they reach either maximum before age 5, look for a seat model with higher maximums. After they grow out of the safety seat range, use a booster seat that utilizes the car\u2019s seat belt until the child is at least 12 years old and 57\u00a0in (140\u00a0cm) tall (at which stage a standard seat belt should fit properly). If a car seat has been in an accident, has exceeded the \u201cexpiration date\u201d printed on it, or is more than 6 years old, it should be replaced. Steer clear of used car seats unless you are absolutely sure they don\u2019t meet any of these criteria. If any of the straps or structural elements of the seat look worn or damaged, replace the seat right away, no matter its age. All child seats\u2014rear-facing car seats, front-facing car seats, and booster seats\u2014should always be installed in the back seats of vehicles. Front airbags are designed to protect an average adult male, and the force of their inflation can easily cause serious injury to a child. If your vehicle doesn\u2019t have a back seat and you have no other driving option, consult the owner\u2019s manual on how to temporarily disable the front passenger air bag. This is still more dangerous than a back seat installation, though. Sure, it\u2019s possible that the only thing more boring to read than a car seat manual is a car\u2019s owner\u2019s manual. But read them anyway! It\u2019s absolutely essential that you know exactly how to install the seat in your vehicle.  Even with some helpful standardization requirements, such as the LATCH system for anchoring car seats in place, there can still be quite a bit of brand-specific variation in the installation process. Around half of all car seats currently in use are installed incorrectly, potentially reducing their effectiveness in a crash. If you have a 2002 or newer vehicle (in the U.S.), use the LATCH system anchor points\u20142 at the base of the seat back, and 1 that\u2019s behind and either above or below the back seat\u2014to secure the car seat. Find the 3 straps with metal clips on the backside of the car seat, and clip each one securely onto its corresponding LATCH anchor point.   Rear-facing car seats may have only 2 anchor straps. If so, anchor them to the 2 LATCH points at the base of the back seat. If you have a pre-2002 vehicle, use the seat and vehicle manuals to guide you through the process of using the vehicle\u2019s seat belt to secure the car seat. You\u2019ll most likely feed the seat belt buckle through designated slots on either side of the car seat\u2019s back, then buckle and tighten the seat belt. Once you\u2019ve secured the clip on each anchoring strap to its corresponding LATCH anchor, put one of your knees onto the car seat to press it down tight. Then, pull on the loose end of each strap with full force to tighten each one as much as you can. After you lift your knee, the anchored seat shouldn\u2019t wiggle more than 1\u00a0in (2.5\u00a0cm) from front-to-back or side-to-side. Even if you read the manuals carefully and are sure you\u2019ve installed the seat properly, you should have an expert check your work and offer tips. Contact your local police department or fire station to see if they offer car seat inspections.  Alternatively, contact your government\u2019s transportation or highway safety departments, or your car insurance company, for info on inspection sites. You can also find U.S. inspection sites online at https://www.nhtsa.gov/equipment/car-seats-and-booster-seats#installation-help-inspection\nWhat is a summary of what this article is about?\n"}], "response": "\u201cPromote\u201d your child to the next seat stage as slowly as possible.

Some might not want to admit it, but there is a hidden Cinderella in everyone's heart--we all wish we could achieve recognition or success after a period of obscurity . Mary Santiago has that secret dream, too. Her story is featured in Another Cinderella Story, a film set in a US high school. Mary is shy but loves to dance. Compared with other girls, she is invisible. However, her world changes completely when a famous teenager pop singer, Joey Parker, appears. Joey is everything the rest of the boys in her class are not--kind, handsome and desirable. Mary and Joey's paths cross at a ball. They meet and fall in love with each other. But when Mary has to rush back home, she leaves behind her MP3 player, which becomes the only clue Joey has to find the girl of his dreams. Of course, there is a wicked  stepmother, who turns out to be Dominique Blatt and she takes in Mary after her dancer mother dies. Dominique treats Mary like a maid and does everything she can to make sure Mary doesn't get into the top dance school. Her two daughters are equally determined to stop Joey falling for Mary, even if that means embarrassing her. The story, though it mostly follows Cinderella, does add a few modern day twists to the classic fairy tale. Refreshingly, the film, unlike many high school films, does not focus on looks, although the actors are all beautiful. There is also a lot less materialism in Another Cinderella Story than in many similar movies. \"The movie takes the Cinderella fairytale as its jumping off point,\" writes movie critic Amber Wilkinson. \"The focus is firmly on following your dream.\" The passage is mainly about   _  . A) an introduction to a film B) a review about a film C) an essay about dreams D) an advertisement of Cinderella\nB\n\n\nQ: A federal agency on Tuesday called for a ban on all cellphone use by drivers -- the most far-reaching recommendation up to now -- saying its decision was based on a decade of investigations into distraction-related  accidents, as well as growing concerns that powerful mobile devices are giving drivers even more reasons to look away from the road. As part of its recommendation, the National Transportation Safety Board is urging states to ban drivers from using hands-free devices, including wireless headsets. No state now has made laws to ban such activity, but the Board said that drivers faced serious risks from talking on wireless headsets, just as they do by taking a hand off the wheel to hold a phone to their ears. However, the concern was heightened by increasingly powerful phones that people can use to send e-mails, watch movies and play games. \"Every year, new devices are being on sale.\" she said. \"People are attracted to update their Facebook page, to play music with cellphone, as if sitting at a desk. But they are driving a car.\" The agency based its recommendation on evidence from its investigation of numerous crashes in which electronic distraction was a major contributing factor. Ms. Hersman said she understood that this recommendation would be unwelcome in some circles, given the number of drivers who talk and text. But she compared distracted driving to drunken driving and even smoking, which required wholesale cultural shifts to change behavior. \"It's going to be very unpopular with some people.\" she said. \"We're not here to win a popularity contest. We're here to do the right thing. This is a difficult recommendation, but it's the right recommendation and it is time.\" The agency's recommendation is not required for states to adopt such a ban. And it won't likely be agreed upon by state lawmakers who are unwillingly to anger those who have grown accustomed to using their device behind the wheel. The ban also deserves attention because it is the first call by a federal agency to end the practice... The ban on all cellphone use by drivers was put forward  _  . A) after a long discussion and recommendation B) after about ten years' investigation in it C) because of the most powerful mobile devices D) for the reason of heading away from the road\nA: B\n\n\nMary Cassatt was born in Pennsylvania in 1844. When she was seven, her family moved to Europe. They wanted their children to understand European ways and the people who lived there. They travelled a lot and she had visited many countries by the time she was 10 years old. After four years they returned to America.        In those days, women didn't have professions, and there were very few women artists. Her family did not approve when she decided that she would become an artist. She studied first in Philadelphia. She happened to be in Chicago in 1871 when the huge fire broke out there. She lost many of her paintings in that fire.        She went to Paris to study painting. She met Camille Pissarro there. He taught her Impressionism, a method of painting where the artists used small strokes   of unmixed color1s to create an image. She once said of Pissarro that \" _ \" because he was such a good teacher. She spent a lot of time at the Louvre Museum copying paintings of the famous artists.        In 1874, her sister, Lydia, came to live with her in Paris. Lydia was her best friend and posed for many of Mary's paintings. Three years later, her parents came to Paris, also to live with them. Lydia became very ill and died from a disease. Mary missed her very much. Her parents became elderly and she cared for them, but she still found time to paint.       One of the more interesting works of Mary Cassatt is her painting, Portrait of Mrs. Curry, Sketch of Mr. Cassatt. Though she never had children of her own, she loved children and painted portraits of the children of her friends and family. She became known as the painter of mothers and children.        She lost her sight due to cataracts  in her eyes in 1914 and was not able to paint during the later years of her life. What is the passage mainly about? A) A brief introduction to Mary Cassatt. B) The main works of Mary Cassatt. C) The influence of Impressionism on Mary Cassatt.

The creativity of the PC Sims game is completely missing (after you create your doctor and choose your pet). As another reviewer noted, cooking can be amusing. It's kind of like Cookin' Mama. Otherwise, it became so tedious that by the second day of owning the game, I stopped playing. The time passage is also problematic as you are forced to sleep when the clinic closes so there's no development of your sim or relationships. I would only recommend this game to someone who loves animals and would like to care for virtual pets. Answer:\n\nChoose your answer from: (i). No (ii).

One group (T) of male Sprague-Dawley rats trained for 1 h/day for 13-17 wk at 30 m/min on a motor-driven treadmill. A second group (UT) of rats was conditioned for 10 min/day for 4 wk at the same speed. Muscle succinate dehydrogenase activities were higher in T than UT rats indicating a significant training effect. Blood flows (BFs) in 32 hindlimb muscles or muscle parts and other selected organs were measured in the two groups with radiolabeled microspheres during preexercise and while the rats ran for 30 s, 5 min, or 15 min at 30 m/min on the treadmill. The data indicate 1) there were no differences in total hindlimb muscle BF between UT and T rats at any time; however, 2) T rats had higher preexercise heart rates and higher muscle BFs in the deep red extensor muscles, suggesting a greater anticipatory response to the impending exercise; 3) T rats demonstrated more rapid elevations in BF in the red extensor muscles at the commencement of exercise; 4) T rats had higher BFs in red extensor muscles during exercise, whereas UT rats had higher BFs in white muscles; and 5) T rats maintained higher BFs in the visceral organs during exercise. These findings demonstrate that exercise training results in changes in the distribution of BF within and among muscles and among organs during exercise. Specifically, data indicate the high-oxidative motor units that are primarily recruited in the muscles during the initial stages of moderate treadmill exercise receive higher blood flows in the trained rats; this presumably contributes to increased resistance to fatigue..

However, the specific role of miRNAs in the metastatic process is still unknown. To seek a specific miRNA expression signature characterizing the metastatic phenotype of solid tumours, we performed a miRNA microarray analysis on 43 paired primary tumours (ten colon, ten bladder, 13 breast, and ten lung cancers) and one of their related metastatic lymph nodes. We identified a metastatic cancer miRNA signature comprising 15 overexpressed and 17 underexpressed miRNAs. Our results were confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. Among the miRNAs identified, some have a well-characterized association with cancer progression, eg miR-10b, miR-21, miR-30a, miR-30e, miR-125b, miR-141, miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-205. To further support our data, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis for three well-defined miRNA gene targets (PDCD4, DHFR, and HOXD10 genes) on a small series of paired colon, breast, and bladder cancers, and one of their metastatic lymph nodes. We found that the immunohistochemical expression of these targets significantly follows the corresponding miRNA deregulation. Our results suggest that specific miRNAs may be directly involved in cancer metastasis and that they may represent a novel diagnostic tool in the characterization of metastatic cancer gene targets..

That was nearly a 12 percent decline from the same month the previous year.\n\nThe average on-time performance for the rest of the system was 91.5 percent that same month, a 1.62 percent decline from the previous May, according to the agency.\n\nThe No. 4\u2019s average on-time performance for the year was slightly better, at 79.7 percent, a 4.8 percent decrease from the previous 12 months. Over all, the system had a 12-month on-time average of 92 percent, a 1.64 percent decrease from the previous cycle.\n\nGene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a rider advocacy group, said the agency\u2019s on-time numbers probably don\u2019t reflect how late trains are at busier stations. That\u2019s because trains often make up time in less-crowded stretches before reaching the end of the line, where the number is measured, he said.\n\nNo. 4 riders say delays are worst between Bowling Green in Lower Manhattan and Union Square.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting slower and slower,\u201d said Brian O\u2019Connell, an undergraduate student at New York University who takes the No. 4 to his job as an intern with the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office. \u201cOne day we stopped at Bowling Green, they told us there was a power outage, we waited 30 minutes and then they said we\u2019re not going anywhere.\n\n\u201cI had to walk to the A-C at Fulton,\u201d he said, referring to the Eighth Avenue line. \u201cThat\u2019s an extreme example, but there are delays all the time.\u201d\n\nAt the Bowling Green station on Monday, riders let out gasps of frustration and amusement when a station agent\u2019s voice came over the intercom. Because of a stalled train at 59th Street, the agent said, their train would be delayed \u201c16 to 30 hours.\u201d Riders were relieved when the train started moving about six minutes later.\n\nBut passengers said those kinds of delays and ambiguous messages were common.\n\n\u201cThey tell us to be patient, I have no choice but to be patient,\u201d said Glenva Brown, 46, who takes the train from the Bronx to Bowling Green on weekdays.\n\nHarvey Johnson, 43, an actor, takes the train to a temporary job in the financial district. \u201cThere are delays and then there are times when it slows or stops on the tracks and they tell you there\u2019s congestion or track work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve been standing on the platform and you know there hasn\u2019t been a train for 15 minutes, so where\u2019s the congestion?\u201d\n\nTransit officials cite track work, customers holding doors, sick and unruly riders and signal trouble as the leading causes for the delays, based on reports from train crews.\n\nOne mystery: Why have delays on the numbered trains, remnants of the city\u2019s former IRT system, increased at nearly double the rate of lettered trains, 30.3 percent versus 15.5 percent?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if we\u2019re operating two systems,\u201d Mr. Roberts told the board.\n\nA board member, Mark Lebow, called the increases \u201castonishing,\u201d and asked for quick action.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can blame increased ridership, because the commuter railroads have the same increased ridership percentages as the subways do, and they seem to be dealing with it,\u201d Mr. Lebow said. \u201cTheir on-time performance is at least as good as it was before and sometimes better.\u201d\n\nMr. Lebow said the problems pointed to a \u201cmanagement issue.\u201d\n\nThe distance subway cars travel between mechanical problems was also down a total of 24.75 percent in May, and 5.19 percent over the last 12 months, a downward trend that has continued since 2005 despite older cars being steadily replaced by newer models.\n\nMr. Roberts attributed part of the problem to cuts to the agency\u2019s maintenance program. Officials did not have specifics Monday on those cutbacks. But Mr. Roberts said the agency was determined to protect maintenance programs.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Subway Delays Rise, and the No. 4 Line Is the Biggest Laggard.

Children need time to stand and stare. They should be allowed to get bored to that they can develop their ability to be creative. Children are expected by their parents to be reading a textbook all the time. However, research shows that it may _ the development of their imagination, while boredom can give them opportunities to develop creativity. Boredom is often linked with loneliness, but a writer named Meera Syal said boredom had helped here in developing her mind. She told researchers about her childhood. Having few things todo, Syal often talked with her neighbors. She also tried to do things like learning to bake cakes. \"But importantly, I Thought and wrote a lot, because I was bored,\" Syal said. She kept a diary, filling here time with short stories and poems she made up. Grayson Perry, an artist, grew up in a family with little money. He enjoyed himself by making up stories, drawing pictures for his stories and reading many books in the library. Bored but free, he spent hours looking out of the window, watching the changing clouds and seasons. Perry filled up his free time with what he liked. He became creative, because he could think freely. Dr. Belton is an expert on the effects of emotions on learning. \"Boredom could be an uncomfortable feeling,\" she said. \"But some young people cannot deal with that boredom creatively. So sometimes they may break a classroom window, or drive a car out for a mad race.\" Usually, when children have nothing to do, they would turn on the TV, the computer, or the phone. Their time on these things has increased, yet they need to have time to think about their experiences through play or just watching the world around them. It is this kind of thinking that can inspire the imagination. On the other hand, the TV or phone may cut short the thinking process. That can be harmful to the development of creativity. \"For developing the ability to be creative,\" Dr. Belton advised, \"perhaps we need to stand and stare, and stay off-line from...\nAnswer:"}], "response": "Question: What can we learn from the passage?Options:A Boredom provides children with space to think freely.B It's much better for children to be busy than be bored.C Boredom helps children deal with difficulties properly.D It's boring for children to think about their experiences.Answer:A"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "D\u00e8s lors, ne devraient-ils pas envisager, avec un peu de modestie et de bon sens, de travailler de concert avec les plus de 130 pays du tiers monde qui ont d\u00fb souffrir cet ordre injuste et qui sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 tenter de persuader le plus puissant de renoncer \u00e0 son arrogance et de remplir ses devoirs de fondateur de l'Organisation des Nations Unies?\n\nWhich language is this?\n"}], "response": "French"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Solve -59176 = -2813*s + 10182 + 6446 + 147 for s.\nSolve this plz.\n\nA: 27\n\n\nSolve -951 + 67 + 91 = -61*q for q.\nSolve this plz.\n\nA: 13\n\n\nSolve -3290*s = 28185 + 12404 + 44951 for s.\nSolve this plz.\n\nA:"}], "response": "-26"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Given the task definition, example input & output, solve the new input case.\nIn this task, you are given an answer, and your task is to generate a reasonable question for that answer.\nExample: My stomach will be upset if i eat that.\nOutput: Do you like pineapple on your pizza?\nThe answer given was regarding something that the person ate and it caused his stomach upset.

He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (n\u00e9e Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \"Joe\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. His father's great-grandfather, July \"Jack\" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \"fat nose\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers\u2014a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine\u2014as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.

A few days later, the farmer and his wife were awakened in the night by a violent storm. They quickly began to check things to see if all was safe from damage. They found that the doors of the farmhouse had been safely fastened, and a lot of wood had been set next to the fireplace. The young man slept soundly. The farmer and his wife then looked at their property   carefully. They found that the farm tools had been placed in the storage room, safe from the bad weather.

A couple of generations ago, an old maid of twenty-five did not have much to look forward to, she was more or less fated to remain with her parents or to live in some relative's home where she would help with the chores and the children. Not so any more. In the first place, women remain young much longer than they used to, and an unmarried woman of twenty-eight or thirty does not feel that her life is over. Besides, since she is probably working and supporting herself, she is free to marry only when and if she chooses. As a result, today's women tend  to marry later in life. They have fewer children-or none at all--if they prefer to devote themselves to their profession. The result is a decline in the birthrate. The new role that women have developed for themselves has changed family life. Children are raised differently; they spend more time with adults who are not their parents: baby sitters, day-care center personnel, relatives, or neighbors. Whether they gain or lose in the process is a hotly debated question. Some child experts believe that young children must spend all their time with their mother if they are to grow sound in body and mind. Others think that children get more from a mother who spends with them \"quality time\" (a time of fun and relaxation set aside for them) rather than hours of forced and unhappy baby sitting. And many child psychologists point out that children kept in day-care centers every day are brighter than those raised at home. No matter what it is, one thing about child-raising to be certain of is that the longer the child is with the mother, the better. Options: A women today have developed a new role in family life B the birthrate is declining as a result of women's pursuit   of careers C women have always been dependent on their parents even after marriage D children must spend all their time with their mother if they are to grow sound Answer: B the birthrate is declining as a result of women's pursuit   of careers Question:???\noutput answer:"}], "response": "It can be concluded from the passage that  _  ."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Q: In this task you will be given a list of integers.

Article: Seventy years ago I was quite a small little girl, the baby of the family, with an older brother and sister. My father was very ill at the time, and my mother took in sewing of any kind so we could live. She would sew far into the night with nothing but dim gas mantles and an old treadle sewing machine. She never complained even when the fire would be low and the food very scarce. She would sew until the early hours of morning. Things were very bad that particular winter. Then a letter came from where her sewing machine was purchased, stating that they would have to pick up her machine the next day unless payments were brought up to date. I remember when she read the letter I became frightened; I could picture us starving to death and all sorts of things that could come to a child's mind. My mother did not appear to be worried, however, and seemed to be quite calm about the matter. I, on the other hand, cried myself to sleep, wondering what would become of our family. Mother said God would not fail her, that he never had. I couldn't see how God was going to help us keep this old sewing machine. The day the men were to come for our only means of support, there was a knock at the kitchen door. I was frightened as a child would be, for I was sure it was those dreaded men. Instead, a nicely dressed man stood at our door with a darling baby in his arms. He asked my mother if she was Mrs. Hill. When she said she was, he said, \"I'm in trouble this morning and you have been recommended by the druggist and grocer down the street as an honest and wonderful woman. My wife was rushed to the hospital this morning, and since we have no relatives here, and I must open my dentist office, I have nowhere to leave my baby. Could you possibly take care of her for a few days?\" He continued, \"I will pay you in advance.\" With this he took out ten dollars and gave it to my mother. Mother said, \"Yes, yes, I will be glad to do so,\" and took the baby from his arms. When the man left, Mother turned to me with tears streaming down a face... Question: What does mother mean by saying \"I knew God would never let them take away my machine.?\" - God can do everything - The sewing machine is my only support - Everybody should believe in God - Never give up when in trouble\nNever give up when in trouble\n\n\n(Question)\nRead the following article and select the best answer.

Ships from all countries go up and down the Thames. They bring food to the people of Britain. Then they take British machines and other things back to the ports from which they come. There are many scenic spots in the West of England. The lakes here are the most beautiful in England. There are trees, flowers and green grass round them. The water is almost always very still,and you can see the green hills ,the brown mountains and everything else round the lake upside-down in the water. There are boats on all the larger lakes, which take people from one side to the other. There are always a lot of boats on the lakes in summer. Travelers from many countries of the world go to the west of England in summer. There are boat races on the largest lakes, and people from many places in Great Britain and Europe come to see them.

Article: Adam Smith was the first person to see the importance of the division of the labor. He gave us an example of the process by which pins were made in England.     One man draws out the wire, another strengthens it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, and a fifth gives it a head. Just to make the head requires two or three different operations. The work of making pins is divided into about eighteen different operations, which in some factories are all performed by different people, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them.     Ten men, Smith said, in this way, turned out twelve pounds of pins a day or about 4,800 pins a worker. But if all of them had worked separately and independently without division of labor, they certainly could not have made twenty pins in a day and not even one.     There can be no doubt that division of labor is an efficient way of organizing work.  Fewer people can make more pins. Adam Smith saw this, but he also took it for granted that the division of labor is itself responsible for economic growth and development and it accounts for the difference between expanding economies and those that stand still. In fact, the division of labor adds nothing new, and it only enables people to produce more of what they already have. Question: According to the writer, Adam Smith's mistake was in believing that the division of labor   _  . - was an efficient way of organizing work - was an important development in methods of production - finally led to economic development - increased the production of existing goods\nAns: finally led to economic development\n\n\nQuestion: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Bali is an Indonesian island rich in indigenous  culture. A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the \"now\". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be \"just like Bali\". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry. One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly knit that all members usually reside in the same complex. Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called \"Hindu Darma\". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this.The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia. In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to conserve their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have preference either for music, dance, or painting. Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the series of ceremonies and rituals known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and color1ful event for the Balinese.

She seduces rich and lonely gentlemen, which results in them footing expensive bills for her clothes, food, and board.

However, he drinks too much and falls asleep before he can keep his promise. Irene glumly visits the bar alone and finds no one in it but the sleeping Jean. Noticing his tuxedo (not realizing it is merely his uniform), Irene assumes he is wealthy hotel guest and awakens him. She chats him up casually, revealing it is her birthday, and that she would kill for a cocktail and some music. To cheer her up, Jacques mixes her a champagne cocktail, but does not reveal that he works at the hotel. Several drinks later, Irene asks his room number and he takes her to an empty suite on the fifth floor. They spend the night, and Irene leaves in the morning.A year later, Jean is surprised to see Irene return to the hotel, still with Jacques. In the dining room, Jean spies Jacques giving Irene an engagement ring which she accepts with enthusiasm. She encounters Jean again, remembering him from the year before. They again meet for drinks and end up in bed. Irene wakes in the morning and rushes back to her suite, realizing she had neglected Jacques for the entire evening.

A quarter of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert\u2019s friends and he buys the rest from the store. How many planks of wood does he need to buy from the store to finish his treehouse?\nAnswer: In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = 50 wooden planks. From his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = 100 wooden planks. So in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 100 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = 170 wooden planks. He therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks \u2013 170 owned wooden planks = 30 wooden planks. The answer is 30.\n[Question]John sublets his apartment to 3 people who each pay $400 per month. He rents the apartment for $900 a month. How much profit does he make in a year?\n[Answer]He gets 3 * $400 = $1200 per month. So he gets 1200 * 12 = $14,400 per year. So he pays 12 * 900 = $10800 a year. That means his profit is 14400 - 10800 = $3600 per year. The answer is 3600.\nQ: Valerie needs to put stamps on the envelopes she is about to mail. She has thank you cards for each of her grandmother, uncle and aunt for the birthday presents they sent. She also has to pay the water bill and the electric bill separately. She wants to send three more mail-in rebates than she does bills and she has twice as many job applications as rebates to mail. How many stamps does she need if everything needs 1 stamp except the electric bill, which needs 2?\nA: Valerie has to send a thank you card to each of 3 people, so she has 3 * 1 = 3 thank you cards to mail. She has 2 bills to mail. She has 3 more rebates than bills, so 3 + 2 = 5 mail - in rebates to mail. She has twice as many job applications as rebates, so she has 2 * 5 = 10 applications to mail. She has 3 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 20 pieces of mail to send. The electric bill needs an extra stamp, so she needs 20 + 1 = 21 stamps. The answer is 21.\nQuestion: Donna cut her pizza into 12 slices and ate half for lunch. She ate 1/3 of the remaining pizza for dinner.

Avoid answers that are incorrect or provides incomplete justification for the question.\nSee one example below:\nProblem: Passage: The French and Indian War (1754\u20131763) was the North American theater of the worldwide Seven Years' War. The war was fought between the colonies of British America and New France, with both sides supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France, as well as Native American allies. At the start of the war, the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 European settlers, compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies. The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians. Long in conflict, the metropole nations declared war on each other in 1756, escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict. Question: When was the French and Indian War?\nSolution: 1754-1763\nExplanation: It is a common convention to write (start year-end year) beside a historical event to understand when the event happened. We can observe a similar notation from the passage to conclude that the French and Indian War happened during 1754\u20131763. Therefore, the answer is 1754\u20131763.\n\nProblem: Passage: Many traditional festivals and customs were observed in the old times, which included climbing the City Wall on January 16, bathing in Qing Xi on March 3, hill hiking on September 9 and others (the dates are in Chinese lunar calendar).

Next we hated the 'reservoir' that was always being re-filled and went 24/7 to keep it hot....but it never kept it hot. We also 'hated' the design of the lid that had to be slid back and forth. The warming plate never stayed warm. Actually there was not one thing we liked about this coffeemaker. We went back to our previous brand that we loved...a Cuisinart.

Movie title: Poison Ivy Context: Sylvie Cooper (Melissa Gilbert) is a alienated and misanthropic teenage girl at a private high school for the wealthy. She first meets \"Ivy\" (Drew Barrymore), a poor but intelligent and highly trashy girl, at a local hangout where Ivy enjoyed rope-swinging from a tree. A young boy runs up and says, \"Come on! A dog got hit!\" Sylvie kneels next to the still breathing dog when all of a sudden Ivy crushes the dog's skull with a pipe (to put it out of its misery).While sitting in the office for phoning in a bomb threat to a local TV station (that Sylvie's father works for) she sees Ivy walk in and begins to talk to her. Later that day, when Sylvie's father (Tom Skeritt) picks her up, Ivy asks for a ride. At first Darrel, Sylvie's father, is reluctant, but grudgingly compromises. Ivy tells Sylvie she gets car sick and asks to ride in the front (a ruse to get near Darrel, Ivy has a bit of a fetish for older men). Ivy puts her bare feet on the dashboard and allows her mini-skirt to shrug back onto her hip revealing her legs. Darrel takes notice.A few weeks later, after Sylvie is no longer grounded, they meet again at the same hangout. They walk to Sylvie's house together, on the way Sylvie tells Ivy that Darrel is her adoptive father and that her biological father was black. She also says that she once tried to kill herself. Sylvie invites Ivy into her parent's mansion. They walk into the living room overlooking the San Fernando Valley. Ivy says that if she were to kill herself she'd like to fall. Sylvie's sickly mother, Georgie (Cheryl Ladd), walks in on their conversation, and it turns out that Sylvie was lying about her attempted suicide and her father.

At the time most animated movies were a little too childish for my tastes. This movie deals with more serious issues, and therefore has a little more emotional impact. In this movie characters can DIE, and be sent to HELL! This gives a little more emotional weight to the scenes where characters are risking their lives.

A NATO monitoring facility observes the return of Dr. Evil, confronting his son Scott, and then starting a riot, on The Jerry Springer Show, and informs British intelligence. At Dr. Evil's Seattle headquarters, Dr. Evil is presented with a one-eighth-size clone of himself whom he calls Mini-Me. Dr. Evil unveils his latest evil plan: he has developed a time machine to go back to the 1960s and steal Austin's mojo, the source of Austin's sexual appeal. Dr. Evil and Mini-Me go back to 1969 and meet a younger Number Two and Frau Farbissina. An obese \"Scottish Guard\" called Fat Bastard extracts Austin's mojo from his frozen body at the Ministry of Defence Cryo Chamber. British intelligence warns Austin that one of Dr. Evil's agents is after him, and during a photo shoot the wanton Ivana Humpalot seduces him, but at the last moment she claims he is too sexy for her to kill him. They have sex in his bed, but do not get far before he discovers that he has lost his mojo and is impotent. The MOD sends Austin back to 1969 with its own time travel device, a convertible Volkswagen New Beetle. Austin arrives at a party in his London pad and with the assistance of a CIA agent, Felicity Shagwell, escapes an assassination attempt by two of Dr. Evil's operatives. Austin and Felicity are pursued by Mustafa, another of Dr. Evil's henchmen; when caught he reveals the existence of Dr. Evil's secret volcano lair.

Young married couple Andrew Hinklin and Clara Hinklin n\u00e9e Fields, who were college sweethearts, are well matched: both are unexciting and unmotivated, only wanting to carve out a plain, simple uninteresting life for themselves. Their marriage is not helped by Clara's opinionated mother living with them in their small one bedroom apartment. However, Clara does wish that their life would be a little more exciting as Andrew said on their honeymoon that their married life would be, least of all by Andrew acknowledging their latest wedding anniversary, their fifth. Clara's wish takes an unexpected turn when Andrew, at work, is assigned to show the visiting Mr. Battingcourt Jr. - the younger half of the head of their London office and who is majority shareholder of their accounting firm - a good time while he's in the US. \"Batty\" as he is affectionately called by his friends is a party animal, and Andrew, who Batty rechristens \"Hinky\", feels he has to party along all in the name of job security. Clara feels that she is losing her stable husband Andrew to Hinky the party animal. Feeling he is partly to blame for the Hinklins' marital problems, Batty advises Clara that she can make herself more exciting to Hinky by changing her demeanor and appearance, more like Mercedes Vasquez, a beautiful and exciting woman who Clara could resemble if made up correctly. Clara agrees to Batty's plan to come to one of their parties masquerading as exotic Latina Dolores Alvaradez, to woo Hinky and thus ultimately show him that she can be exotic like he probably now wants.

Hirata's parents died there seven years ago, and the seven year death anniversary is a significant event in Japanese culture. Hirata must perform a ceremony in the river where they died after drowning in an avalanche \u2013 the drowned must be fed by the surviving family members if they are to find peace. Hirata goes to Iceland \u2013 to Reykjav\u00edk. His final destination is a remote river on the far side of the island. He encounters one mishap and misadventure after another. He first accidentally gets on a wrong bus filled with German tourists traveling to see the hot springs. He also confronts a language barrier; Hirata cannot speak any Icelandic, and knows very little English. After his first day's misadventures, Hirata decides to purchase an ancient, bright red Citro\u00ebn DS to make the journey. During the long drive, Hirata meets several strange people along the way. These include the mystical woman who sells him the car, that only plays one radio station. Next, Hirata meets a local woman who collects photographs of funerals. The following day, Hirata meets two American hitchhiker/fugitives (Lili Taylor and Fisher Stevens), who turn out to be armed and dangerous who proceed to steal his car.

Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of war materiel during the Second World War, such as the Avro Manchester and Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power the Spitfire, Hurricane, Mosquito and the Lancaster. The engines were made by Ford, under licence. The 17,316 workers employed in Ford's purpose-built factory had produced 34,000 engines by the war's end. The facility was designed in two separate sections to minimise the impact of bomb damage on production. The wood-working factory of F. Hills & Sons built more than 800 Percival Proctor aircraft for the RAF between 1940 and 1945, which were flight tested at the nearby Barton Aerodrome. Other companies produced gun bearings, steel tracks for Churchill tanks, munitions, Bailey bridges, and much else. ICI built and operated the first facility in the UK able to produce penicillin in quantity.As an important industrial area, the park suffered from extensive bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of December 1940. On the night of 23 December 1940, the Metropolitan-Vickers aircraft factory in Mosley Road was badly damaged, with the loss of the first 13 MV-built Avro Manchester bombers in final assembly. The new Ford factory producing aircraft engines was bombed only a few days after its opening in May 1941. Trafford Hall was severely damaged by bombing, and was demolished shortly after the war ended.In the December 1940 air raids, stray bombs aiming for Trafford Park landed on Old Trafford football stadium, the nearby home of Manchester United, but this air raid only resulted in minor damage and matches were soon being played at the stadium again. On 11 March 1941, however, stray bombs aimed at Trafford Park fell onto Old Trafford for a second time, causing serious damage to the stadium. It was comprehensively rebuilt after the war and re-opened in 1949, until which time Manchester United played their home games at Maine Road, the stadium of Manchester City in Moss Side.At the outbreak of war in...\n++++++++\nAnswer:"}], "response": "Trafford Hall"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Problem: u.s. troops continued to battle iraqi forces on the southern outskirts of the capital after securing baghdad 's international airport , a crucial step toward establishing a base of operations near the city .\n\nWhat is a very short summary of the above text?\n++++++++++\nA: u.s. forces battle for control of baghdad airport\n\n\nquestion: as talks on afghanistan 's political future sputter , diplomats worry that any accord with the northern alliance could fail to win the support of warlords back home .\n\nWrite a brief summary in a sentence or so.\nsummary: northern alliance holds out on accord for interim afghan\n\n\nthe trial of a second white man accused of dragging a black man to death will remain in jasper , a state judge ruled thursday .\n\nA summary about the text above: second dragging death trial will remain in jasper\n\n\nQuestion:\nSummarize this: argentine super soccer star diego maradona will visit china and play two matches against two local teams .\nAnswer:\nmaradona to visit china\n\n\nText: u.s. and afghan forces traded gunfire with insurgents shooting from haystacks in poppy fields tuesday as nato forces progressed against increasingly fitful resistance in the taliban stronghold of marjah .\n\nSummary: marines say taliban resistance more disorganized\n\n\nProblem: muslim militants accused the plo on thursday of conspiring with israel to `` wage war against islam , '' while divisions arose among the palestinian police over how hard to crack down on the radicals .\n\nWhat is a very short summary of the above text?\n++++++++++\nA:"}], "response": "islamic militants accuse plo of war against islam"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "In this task, you are given a sentence in the English language and your task is to convert it into the Swedish language.

Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation.  Paragraph: A large amount of radioactive waste was found near the town of Arrester. An unusual number of people in Arrester have cancer. In a town 100 miles north of Arrester named Ajani very few people have cancer. There is no radioactive waste near the town of Ajani  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will a person who is not exposed to radiation have an increased or decreased chance of developing cancer?\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe answer is:\ndecreased\n\n\ninput question: Background: There are many examples in the chemical world of changes in entropy. Phase transitions are one obvious example. When a substance makes a transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements, because they are no longer confined to a specified volume in which they are close to each other; gas particles can move freely throughout their container. Vaporization represents an increase in entropy. In the opposite direction, a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid. Because solids have very ordered structures, there are fewer possible arrangements of particles that would result in the properties associated with a solid.  Paragraph: Rob was in his chemistry lab, experimenting with different states of matter. He had a liquid substance that he labeled as state A. He then transformed half of the liquid substance to gaseous state. He labeled it as state B. Finally, he froze the remaining half of the liquid to solid state. He labeled it as state C.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would state A have less or more possible arrangements than state B????\noutput answer: less\n\n\nBackground: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them \u2013 just as no-till \u2013 categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.  Paragraph: Jake and Todd used different farming methods to produce their crops. Jake always tills his land, while Todd uses he no-tillage method.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farmer provided a good environment for pathogens?\n----\nAnswer: Todd\n\n\nQ: Background: This individual monetary gain creates an increase in the overall economic productivity of a country. Girls are underrepresented in schooling, meaning that investments aimed specifically at educating women should produce bigger dividends.[9] Although investment in women's education is not present everywhere, David Dollar and Roberta Gatti have presented findings that show that this decision, along with other failures to invest in women are not \u201can efficient economic choice for developing countries\u201d and that \"countries that under-invest grow more slowly.\u201d[3] Looking holistically at the opportunity cost of not investing in girls, the total missed GDP growth is between 1.2% and 1.5%.[10] When looking at different regions, it is estimated that 0.4\u20130.9% of the difference in GDP growth is accounted for solely by differences in the gender gap in education.[1] The effect of the educational gender gap is more pronounced when a country is only moderately poor.[3] Thus the incentive to invest in women goes up as a country moves out of extreme poverty.[3]  Paragraph: Ethiopia and Sudan are two neighboring countries where  extreme poverty can be seen. Still Ethiopia has pushed for women's education in the last decade. Sudan has largely failed in investing on women's education. Elsewhere in Africa, the country of Botswana has just overcome extreme poverty, thanks to vast mineral deposits. But they invested on women's education.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would Ethiopia's economic growth be slower or faster than Sudan's one?\nA: faster\n\n\nQuestion: Background: Current Situation : Currently the heating effect of extra greenhouse gases (since the start of the industrial revolution) is equal to about . Thus the recent period has recorded parallel increases in concentration of carbon dioxide and average global temperature. As more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere the temperature will increase further. There are certain effects of a warmer Earth (discussed more in optional section), which could accelerate the process, even if no more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere (an unlikely prospect for the foreseeable future).  Paragraph: Last week, an exact clone of Earth appeared next to our current Earth. Scientists have come to call this new planet, Terra. Terra has the exact same cities, civilizations and history as Earth. Scientists are completely baffled as to how this planet exists, but it undeniably does. The only difference between Earth and Terra is that the citizens of Terra output half as many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as citizens of Earth do.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which planet will have a higher average temperature?\nAnswer: Earth\n\n\nPlease answer this: Background: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, $8,033/ha and $13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.  Paragraph: The southern province was exposed to intensive grazing for many years , and now soil quality is poor and dust storms are present. The northern province has more fertile soil, more trees.

Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (n\u00e9e Finlay), was a homemaker who had worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Swift was named after the American singer-songwriter James Taylor. She has a younger brother named Austin, who is an actor. Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients. She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by Franciscan nuns, before transferring to The Wyndcroft School. The family then moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.At the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure that she needed to go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since \"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different\".When Swift was about 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her how to play guitar and helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading to her writing \"Lucky You\".

Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story. She visits the gang that Harry hung out with in a caf\u00e9 in Battersea and they agree to help her by trying to find the couple in the parked car.

Following his work as vocalist on Steve Vai's 1993 album Sex & Religion and its 1994 tour, Townsend believed he had been a \"musical whore\", spending \"the first five years of [his] career working at the behest of other people\". During a brief stint as touring guitarist for The Wildhearts, Townsend received a phone call from an A&R representative for Roadrunner Records, expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. The offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of Roadrunner, who regarded Townsend's recordings as \"just noise\". He faced further rejection by Relativity Records, the label behind Vai's Sex & Religion, who saw no commercial appeal in his music. Century Media Records subsequently contacted the musician, offering him a contract to \"make us some extreme albums\". Townsend agreed to a five-album deal with the record label.Following his tour with The Wildhearts, Townsend began recording and producing his debut album, Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing, under the moniker Strapping Young Lad. According to Townsend, the recording process took \"about a week\". Embracing The Wildhearts' anarchist approach, \"while focusing on dissonance and just being as over-the-top as [he] could\", Townsend sang on the record and performed the majority of its instrumental tracks (with the assistance of a drum machine).  A few songs, however, featured local session musicians, including guitarist Jed Simon, Townsend's future bandmate. Released on April 4, 1995, Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing was not widely recognized in the metal community. The album sold 143 copies in its first six months, but received favorable reviews from the heavy metal press. Its unusual musical ideas\u2014a synthesis of death, thrash, and industrial metal influences\u2014prompted Andy Stout from Metal Hammer to call it \"one of the most disturbing albums you'll hear for a very long time\".

The reigning Super Bowl champion Seahawks wrapped up the NFC West crown with a 20-6 victory over the St Louis Rams that gave them the No 1 playoff seed in the NFC. Aaron Rodgers tosses a touchdown pass to Randall Cobb while badly hobbling with a calf injury. Lambeau Field was wracked with tension as the MVP favourite was escorted away from the action. Cobb leaps into the crowd after scoring in the third quarter during the Packers' vital victory. While not as cold as many of Lambeau's storied nights, both teams battled below-zero temperatures.

Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii are barred from taking part in any soccer-related activity -- whether it is administrative tasks, athletic competitions or otherwise. The bans take effect immediately, though the move is \"provisional\" and could be reversed as the investigation continues. \"Today is a sad day for football and for FIFA,\" said Claudio Sulser, chairman of FIFA's ethics committee, which voted unanimously to issue the suspensions. A FIFA member since 2006, Adamu, 57, is the director of sports development in his native Nigeria. Temarii, 43, is president of the Oceania Football Confederation and advisor to the French Polynesian government. He has been on FIFA's executive committee for the past six years. In addition, the ethics committee provisionally suspended four other officials -- Slim Aloulou, Amadou Diakite, Ahongalu Fusimalohi and Ismael Bhamjee -- from soccer-related activities after tying them to the World Cup bribe scandal. All four are members of international soccer federations affiliated with FIFA. The announcement comes three days after the Sunday Times of London published an article headlined, \"World Cup votes for sale.\" In an undercover operation, the newspaper's reporters said they approached six current or former FIFA officials, all of whom \"suggested paying huge bribes to FIFA executive committee members.\" Two of the six asked for direct payment themselves, the paper reported. FIFA began investigating Adamu and Temarii on Monday. The ethics committee will meet again in mid-November as it investigates all six cases, according to FIFA. The six suspensions will last 30 days and could be extended another 20 days, FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke said Wednesday. \"We have enough time until mid-November to see if (the allegations) are more than rumors, but facts,\" said Valcke. There are four candidates, all in Europe, to host the 2018 tournament: England, Russia and a pair of dual bids, one from Spain and Portugal, the other from Belgium and the Netherlands. The United States, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Qatar all hope to be home to the 2022 tournament.

At the magicians' commands, the fans in the vault activate, drawing the bills into the vents and then showering the Las Vegas crowd with them.

Movie plot title: The North Avenue Irregulars Movie plot: Reverend Michael Hill (Edward Herrmann) and his two children arrive in a fictional California town. He is there to serve as the new minister at the North Avenue Presbyterian Church. The secretary/music director for the church, Anne (Susan Clark), is wary of the changes Hill intends to implement. Hill wants to get people involved, and asks Mrs. Rose Rafferty (Patsy Kelly, in her final movie role) to handle the church's sinking fund. On his first Sunday, Hill learns from Mrs. Rafferty that her husband Delaney (Douglas Fowley) bet all the sinking fund money on a horse race. Hill delivers a sermon less than 15 seconds long, then rapidly escorts Mrs. Rafferty out the church as astonished worshipers watch. She leads him to the bookie, hidden behind a dry-cleaning shop, and meets Harry the Hat (Alan Hale, Jr.), who recommends that Hill let the bet ride. Hill's horse loses and he is thrown out of the betting parlor. Hill summons the police, but the booking joint has been skillfully removed. That evening, Hill delivers a tirade against the organized crime in the city during a local television broadcast. He is chastised by his presbytery superiors for the tirade, and is urged to go out and build church membership in the area. His only success is with a rock band called Strawberry Shortcake, who he recruits to \"jazz up\" the music at church; Anne resigns as music director. Then, two treasury agents for the US government arrive: Marvin Fogleman (Michael Constantine) and Tom Voohries (Steve Franken). They want Hill to help them close down the gambling racket by recruiting some men from the church to place bets that the agents will watch. Hill cannot find any men to help, but hits upon the idea of using women. Five women from his congregation (and Delany, whose wife does not drive) attempt to place bets in the company of the Treasury agents, but with disastrous clumsiness.

Movie plot title: Becoming Jane Movie plot: Jane Austen is the younger daughter of Reverend George Austen and his wife and has yet to find a suitable husband. She aspires to be a writer, to the dismay of her mother and proud delight of her father. Thomas Lefroy is a promising lawyer with a bad reputation, which he describes as \"typical\" for people in the profession. Tom makes a terrible first impression upon meeting Jane, when he nearly falls asleep while she gives a reading of her work for the company. Overhearing his subsequent criticism, Jane cannot stand the arrogant Irishman. Meanwhile, she turns down the affections of other men, including Mr. Wisley, the nephew and heir of the wealthy Lady Gresham. Wisley proposes but Jane ultimately rejects him due to lack of affection. The mischievous Tom encounters Jane again; they argue but increasingly take interest in each other and Tom demonstrates that he takes Jane's literary aspirations seriously. In time they fall in love. Tom, Jane, her brother Henry and Jane's rich widowed cousin, Eliza, Comtesse de Feullide, conspire to receive an invitation from Tom's uncle and benefactor, the Lord Chief Judge Langlois of London, for the rich \"Madame La Comtesse\" and her friends. This visit is meant to be a short break in their journey to see Jane's brother, Edward. This would allow Judge Langlois to get to know Jane before and give a blessing for their marriage. Full of hope, Jane cannot sleep during the night at the Judge's place. In a flow of inspiration, she then begins the writing of First Impressions, the manuscript that will become Pride and Prejudice. However, Judge Langlois receives a letter informing him of the genteel poverty of Jane's family and he refuses to give Tom his blessing, declaring that he would wish Tom to be the whoremonger he had been rather than allow him to live in poverty because of a bad marriage. Tom tells Jane that he cannot marry her and she is crushed, not knowing that Tom has a legitimate reason; his family depends on him financially.

Through reading her mother's papers, Victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply; she was heart-broken, and blamed Conroy and Lehzen for \"wickedly\" estranging her from her mother. To relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief, Albert took on most of her duties, despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble. In August, Victoria and Albert visited their son, the Prince of Wales, who was attending army manoeuvres near Dublin, and spent a few days holidaying in Killarney. In November, Albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in Ireland. Appalled, Albert travelled to Cambridge, where his son was studying, to confront him. By the beginning of December, Albert was very unwell. He was diagnosed with typhoid fever by William Jenner, and died on 14 December 1861. Victoria was devastated. She blamed her husband's death on worry over the Prince of Wales's philandering. He had been \"killed by that dreadful business\", she said. She entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life. She avoided public appearances, and rarely set foot in London in the following years. Her seclusion earned her the nickname \"widow of Windsor\".\n\nNow answer this question: What year did Victoria's mother die?\n\nOutput: 1861\n\nInput: Article: Many types of sports equipment are made of wood, or were constructed of wood in the past.

Question: Legalism and Huang-Lao Daoism lost ground to? Context: The early Western Han court simultaneously accepted the philosophical teachings of Legalism, Huang-Lao Daoism, and Confucianism in making state decisions and shaping government policy. However, the Han court under Emperor Wu gave Confucianism exclusive patronage. He abolished all academic chairs or erudites (b\u00f3sh\u00ec \u535a\u58eb) not dealing with the Confucian Five Classics in 136 BC and encouraged nominees for office to receive a Confucian-based education at the Imperial University that he established in 124 BC. Unlike the original ideology espoused by Confucius, or Kongzi (551\u2013479 BC), Han Confucianism in Emperor Wu's reign was the creation of Dong Zhongshu (179\u2013104 BC). Dong was a scholar and minor official who aggregated the ethical Confucian ideas of ritual, filial piety, and harmonious relationships with five phases and yin-yang cosmologies. Much to the interest of the ruler, Dong's synthesis justified the imperial system of government within the natural order of the universe. The Imperial University grew in importance as the student body grew to over 30,000 by the 2nd century AD. A Confucian-based education was also made available at commandery-level schools and private schools opened in small towns, where teachers earned respectable incomes from tuition payments.\nAnswer: Confucianism\n\n\n[Q]: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

In this rough-house farce, Davis is tossed on her bottom in a cactus patch & de-spined by Jimmy! Bette's a Texas oil heiress trying to elope with bandleader Jack Carson. Cagney, a pilot, agrees to mess up her plans & deliver her to her father -unwed- at ten dollars a pound air freight! The two top stars indulge in crazy antics in this audience pleaser; Max Steiner's score is highly amusing. Answer:\nYes\n--\nIs this product review positive? Title: No \"mumbo-jumbo jive\" here... Review: As always, Dolly is down-right adorable, exuding style, grace and class, and at the same time looking lovely while she shares her unique pearls of wisdom in both her dialogue and songs; the latter being largely tailor-made for the film and still strong enough to stand on their own. In addition to her remarkable singing voice, what an infectious laugh this talented lady has! James Woods is at his most charming and comedic. The cast as a whole does quite well and the story is engaging. This is a fun film that has held up well over the years.

Until 1964 it was known as the Army Council.  - Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.  - The Master-General of the Ordnance (MGO) was a very senior British military position, usually held by a serving general. The Master-General of the Ordnance was responsible for all British artillery, engineers, fortifications, military supplies, transport, field hospitals and much else, and was not subordinate to the commander-in chief of the British military. Between 1855, and 1904, the post did not exist. In March 2013, the holder was titled as \"Director Land Capability and Transformation\" but still sat on the Army Board as Master-General of the Ordnance.

It is the birthplace of the United Nations. Located at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula, San Francisco is about in area, making it the smallest countyand the only consolidated city-countywithin the state of California. With a density of about 18,451 people per square mile (7,124 people per km), San Francisco is the most densely settled large city (population greater than 200,000) in California and the second-most densely populated major city in the United States after New York City. San Francisco is the fourth-most populous city in California, after Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose, and the 13th-most populous city in the United Stateswith a census-estimated 2015 population of 864,816. The city and its surrounding areas are known as the San Francisco Bay Area, and are a part of the larger OMB-designated San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland combined statistical area, the fifth most populous in the nation with an estimated population of 8.7 million.  - Alma mater (Latin: ' \"nourishing/kind\", ' \"mother\"; pl. [rarely used] \"\") is an allegorical Latin phrase for a university or college. In modern usage, it is a school or university which an individual has attended, or a song or hymn associated with that school. The phrase is variously translated as \"nourishing mother\", \"nursing mother\", or \"fostering mother\", suggesting that a school provides intellectual nourishment to its students.  - A university (\"a whole\", \"a corporation\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects.  Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education.  - Stanford University, officially Leland Stanford Junior University, is a private research university in Stanford, California, adjacent to Palo Alto and between San Jose and San Francisco. Its campus is one of the largest in the United States. Stanford also has land and facilities elsewhere.  - Ephraim Douglass Adams (December 18, 1865 in Decorah, Iowa  September 1, 1930 in Stanford, California) was an American educator and historian, regarded as an expert on the American Civil War and British-American relations. He was known as a great teacher, with the ability to inspire teachers and researchers, and his presentation style was copied by Stanford historian Thomas A. Bailey.  - The American Pageant, initially published by Thomas A. Bailey in 1956, is an American high school history textbook often used for AP United States History, AICE American History as well as IB History of the Americas courses. Since Bailey's death in 1983, the book has been updated by historians David M. Kennedy and Lizabeth Cohen, and it is now in its sixteenth edition.  - Lizabeth Cohen is the current Howard Mumford Jones Professor of American Studies at Harvard University, as well as the Dean of Harvard's Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Currently, she teaches courses in 20th-century America, material and popular culture, and gender, urban, and working-class history. She has also served as the Chair of the History Department at Harvard and director of the undergraduate program in history.  - Thomas Andrew Bailey ( December 14 , 1902 -- July 26 , 1983 ) was a professor of history at his alma mater , Stanford University , and authored many historical monographs on diplomatic history , including the widely used American history textbook , The American Pageant . He was known for his witty style and clever terms he coined , such as `` international gangsterism . '' He popularized diplomatic history with his entertaining textbooks and lectures , the presentation style of which followed Ephraim Douglass Adams . Bailey contended foreign policy was significantly affected by public opinion , and that current policymakers could learn from history .  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \"real world\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.

Although I have not made many knitted toys, I am an experienced knitter. I am at present deciphering my way through the pattern for Loulou the elephant - the pattern has errors and combined with a lack of schematics it is taking a little longer than it should. The only other book I have used for knitted toys is \"The Knitted Teddy Bear\" by Sandra Polley and as it turns out is published by the same publisher. Sandra Polley's book by comparison is a gold mine of instructions, schematics and general help. And so far, no errors. Toys to Knit is another of those books that uses Rowan yarns and why is it that they ALWAYS stipulate far more yarn than is required? Just another sales tool of Rowan Yarns?

They are SLIGHTLY better than the old, bent beaters with the popped rivets that I was trying to replace, but they are not really a suitable replacement.

Baffled by the request, he agrees. The two arrive at the justice of the peace's home late in the night, and pay him to marry them. Emily then savagely murders the justice of the peace during the ceremony, and flees. She later gloats to a mute, invalid elderly woman named Helga (for whom Emily is a nurse and works for a wealthy family) of her deed. The police investigate the crime and learn that the nurse was given the name of a local flower shop owner Miriam Webster (Breslin), who has an alibi of the night of the murder. It is revealed that Miriam and her brother Warren, who has recently returned from Denmark after the death of his last surviving parent, are heirs to Warren's father's estate. The two talk about how Warren's father was abusive to Warren growing up and the details of the will. Miriam stands to inherit the estate if Warren dies before marrying, as Warren's father was a misogynist who went out of his way to make Warren his sole heir so that only a male child of his could inherit. Miram also confesses to Warren good news of her own, that she is engaged to be married to her boyfriend. That evening, Emily breaks into Miriam's flower shop and wrecks the store. She is interrupted by Miriam's boyfriend, who comes to the store because he did not know that Miriam had left early that evening. Miriam and her boyfriend arrive at Warren's house the next day to visit Helga and confront Emily. Helga frantically tries to communicate with Miriam, who later finds out from Warren that Emily is actually his wife; he had hired her to take care of Helga and ultimately married her.

Question: What happened to Alfonso's first son? Context: A year before Alfonso III \"the Great\" of Asturias death, three of Alfonso's sons rose in rebellion and forced him to abdicate, partitioning the kingdom among them. The eldest son, Garc\u00eda, became king of Le\u00f3n. The second son, Ordo\u00f1o, reigned in Galicia, while the third, Fruela, received Asturias with Oviedo as his capital. Alfonso died in Zamora, probably in 910. His former realm would be reunited when first Garc\u00eda died childless and Le\u00f3n passed to Ordo\u00f1o. He in turn died when his children were too young to ascend; Fruela became king of a reunited crown. His death the next year initiated a series of internecine struggles that led to unstable succession for over a century. It continued under that name[clarification needed] until incorporated into the Kingdom of Castile in 1230, after Ferdinand III became joint king of the two kingdoms. This was done to avoid dynastic feuds and to maintain the Christian Kingdoms strong enough to prevent complete Muslim take over of the Iberian Peninsula and to further the Reconquista of Iberia by Christian armies.\n----\nAnswer: Garc\u00eda, became king of Le\u00f3n\n\n\nExtract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Other than cruise ships, what floods the area along with ferries as measured throughout the year? Context: The port of Palermo, founded by the Phoenicians over 2,700 years ago, is, together with the port of Messina, the main port of Sicily. From here ferries link Palermo to Cagliari, Genoa, Livorno, Naples, Tunis and other cities and carry a total of almost 2 million passengers annually. It is also an important port for cruise ships. Traffic includes also almost 5 million tonnes of cargo and 80.000 TEU yearly. The port also has links to minor sicilian islands such as Ustica and the Aeolian Islands (via Cefal\u00f9 in summer).

Question: What phrase shows the author's bias against heresy? Context: The term heresy is also used as an ideological pigeonhole for contemporary writers because, by definition, heresy depends on contrasts with an established orthodoxy. For example, the tongue-in-cheek contemporary usage of heresy, such as to categorize a \"Wall Street heresy\" a \"Democratic heresy\" or a \"Republican heresy,\" are metaphors that invariably retain a subtext that links orthodoxies in geology or biology or any other field to religion.

The patient's personal problems are in question until Stevens' secretary is also found brutally murdered. Stevens realizes he is the murderer's target, while the detectives treat him as their prime suspect. A widower, Stevens expresses concern to his physician brother-in-law about the cops' behavior.

Morgens saves his life by finding a bomb planted in Stevens' car. After he reports this latest attempt on his life, Angeli promises to lend Stevens a more sympathetic ear than his partner had.

High PaCO2, low PaCO2, SD of PaCO2, and difference in PaCO2 predicted severe intraventricular hemorrhage, but time-weighted average PaCO2 was not as predictive.\nStudent:"}], "response": "Are both extremes of arterial carbon dioxide pressure and the magnitude of fluctuations in arterial carbon dioxide pressure associated with severe intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants?"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Q: Translate \"The vote will take place on 19 February 2008.\" to Finnish?\n\nA: \u00c4\u00e4nestys toimitetaan 19. helmikuuta 2008.\ninput question: Write a sentence not in English.\noutput answer: Irlannin tasavallan maatalousministeri on osoittanut selv\u00e4sti, ett\u00e4 h\u00e4n huolehtii omistaan ensin.\nQ: Translate \"In Britain, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has recently reduced the VAT rate in an endeavour to combat the recession.\" to Finnish?\nYes: Yhdistyneess\u00e4 kuningaskunnassa valtionvarainministeri laski \u00e4skett\u00e4in ALV-astetta taantuman torjumiseksi.\n[Q]: Ratkaisut, joilla traktoreita voidaan mukauttaa uusien moottoreiden vaatimusten mukaisiksi, eiv\u00e4t useissa tapauksissa ole viel\u00e4 saatavilla tai lopullisia.\n\nTranslate this to English?\n[A]: In many cases, the solutions for adapting tractors to the new engines are not yet available or final.\nQuestion:\nOperaattorien m\u00e4\u00e4r\u00e4n lis\u00e4\u00e4ntyminen merkitsee kilpailun lis\u00e4\u00e4ntymist\u00e4, joten huutokauppojen lopputulos on mielest\u00e4mme vain my\u00f6nteinen kilpailun kannalta.\n\nCould you please translate this to English?\nAnswer:\nMore players mean more competition, so we can only welcome the outcome of the auctions from a competitive standpoint.\nQuestion:\nOlemme jo k\u00e4sitelleet kiireellisi\u00e4 asioita, ja mielest\u00e4ni kaikki ryhm\u00e4t ovat samaa mielt\u00e4 Zimbabwen, Kongon ja Bhopalin kysymysten pit\u00e4misest\u00e4 esityslistalla.\n\nCould you please translate this to English?\nAnswer:\n"}], "response": "We have already dealt with the pressing business and I think all of the groups are in agreement with keeping Zimbabwe, Congo and Bhopal on the agenda."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Solve 6*v - 52 = -70 for v.\nSolve this problem.\n"}], "response": "-3"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Q: Translate \"The \u201cShushi Revival\u201d Fund has started realizing a vast programme entitled \u201cReconstruction of the System of water supply of Shushi\u201d.

They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery in the forest behind the Creeds' new home. On his first day at work, Louis meets Victor Pascow, a jogger who is brought in with severe injuries from a car accident. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met. After he dies, Pascow comes to Louis in the night and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is \"sour\". Louis awakens assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt. During Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat Church is run down on the highway in front of the house. Realizing that Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an abandoned Micmac burial ground. Without explanation Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone else about what they have done. The next day Church comes back to life, though a shell of what he was before; he stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious towards Louis. Jud explains that he himself revived his beloved pet dog in the Micmac ground as a boy, and that although the cat might be different it will save Ellie the grief of losing her favorite pet. Sometime later, Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway. The family is devastated and Jud anticipates that Louis is considering burying his son in the Micmac ground, although Louis denies it. Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death.

The shot suddenly begins to travel outwards from Earth at impossible speed, passing Mars, the Asteroid Belt of the Solar System, passing Jupiter, travelling through Saturn's rings and leaving our Solar System. Travel continues even faster, seemingly faster than light, passing the Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula and out of the Milky Way galaxy. The trip passes through another galaxy, finally showing us a field of thousands of galaxies. After a few moments we pass through the iris of a young girl, Ellie Arroway, who is reciting a HAM radio greeting \"C-Q\" (\"seek you\") in her bedroom.Ellie has a gift for science and is encouraged by her kindly father to communicate with people in distant cities on her HAM. Ellie makes contact with someone in Pensacola, Florida, her longest communication yet at over a thousand miles from her home near Madison, Wisconsin. That night Ellie asks if she could ever have a transmitter powerful enough to talk to her deceased mother (who died in childbirth). Her father says he doesn't know but suggests that Ellie is tenacious enough that she probably could accomplish such a task one day.Ellie's father dies one night while they stargaze. Ellie seems to blame herself for not getting her father his heart medication in time. Ellie grows up to become a brilliant astrophysicist, earns her doctorate and begins her research with SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute) at Arecibo in Puerto Rico.At Arecibo, Ellie meets influential spiritual ponderer Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), and has an intense, brief, but detached (on her part) affair with him. One day while looking in a Cracker Jack box, he finds a toy compass and gives it to her, 'so she wont lose her way.' Palmer wants to get closer to Ellie in terms of a relationship, but Ellie is more preoccupied with her search for extra-terrestrial life.

Courtney Crumrin ( which I bought in its monthly comic book form and then again with this collection) is that more special for being written by Ted.If you are a fan of gothic children's tales (Neil Gaiman's children's stories, Jill Thompson's Scary Grandmother) or just love spooky things like the Addams Family and the work of Gorey (the Gashlycrumb Tinies) you are guaranted to love the adventures of Courtney.The art is noirish and beautiful. The characters are menacing, souful, viscious, and lovely ( sometimes all at the same time).

However, its clinical relevance and potential role in HCC remain unknown.', 'Quantitative PCR, Western blots and immunohistochemistry analyses were used to quantify A20 expression in HCC samples and cell lines. The correlation of A20 expression with clinicopathologic features was analyzed in a cohort containing 143 patients with primary HCC. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to evaluate the association between A20 expression and patient survival. Functional studies were performed to determine the effects of A20 on proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Expression of A20 was increased in HCC tissues and cell lines. Increased expression of A20 was negatively correlated with the tumor size, TNM stage, tumor thrombus formation, capsular invasion and serum AFP levels. Patients with higher A20 expression had a prolonged disease-free survival and overall survival than those with lower A20 expression. Forced expression of A20 significantly inhibited the proliferative and invasive properties of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo, whereas knockdown of A20 expression showed the opposite effects. Further studies revealed that expression of A20 was inversely correlated with Twist1 levels and NF-\u03baB activity in HCC tissues and cell lines. A20-induced suppression of proliferation and migration of HCC cells were mainly mediated through inhibition of Twist1 expression that was regulated at least partly by A20-induced attenuation of NF-\u03baB activity.\nAnswer: Our results demonstrate that A20 plays a negative role in the development and progression of HCC probably through inhibiting Twist1 expression. A20 may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for HCC patients.\nA:"}], "response": "Does a20 suppress hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation and metastasis through inhibition of Twist1 expression?"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "question: So is it not time to deal with the vast bulk of world trade and leave agriculture aside? --> French.\nanswer: N'est-il donc pas temps de s'occuper de la majeure partie du commerce mondiale et de laisser l'agriculture de c\u00f4t\u00e9?\nquestion: Roslyn Schwartz has lived in Montr\u00e9al for the last 14 years. --> French.\nanswer: Roslyn Schwartz vit \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al depuis 14 ans.\nquestion: in writing. - (ES) My abstention in relation to this report is because, although pragmatic rules for the creation of parliamentary groups are certainly necessary, I feel that the proposed number of members and of Member States is too high. --> French.\nanswer: par \u00e9crit. - (ES) Bien que des r\u00e8gles pragmatiques me semblent n\u00e9cessaires pour pr\u00e9sider \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation de groupes parlementaires, j'ai choisi l'abstention car le nombre de d\u00e9put\u00e9s et d'\u00c9tats membres propos\u00e9 est \u00e0 mes yeux trop \u00e9lev\u00e9.\nquestion: The applicant shall fill in and sign the forms provided for in paragraph 3. --> French.\nanswer:"}], "response": "Le demandeur compl\u00e8te et signe les formulaires vis\u00e9s au paragraphe 3."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Title: Duped, again Review: My review of this Patricia Cornwell/Kay Scarpetta book \"Cause of Death\" doesn'thave to do with the author or the story but with the publishers who designed adifferent cover for an old book.

More precisely, the emergency room phoned to ask if Ray had a bed. Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \"one treatment episode every three months\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \"No Such Address\" or simply \"Return to Sender\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable. It was fiscal suicide. The hospital was perfectly willing to let the local experts in deadbeats handle the workload. Tonight, Ray could tell them no. He liked telling them no, especially when it was the truth. Who decides if client can come for overnight admission? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A.

My dad was a World War II veteran and an officer. All officers were issued the classic Ray Ban sunglasses with the wraparound wire rims. He wore them almost all the time for the next thirty years after the War, then one day in the 1970\u2019s, he misplaced them. He was heartbroken, crestfallen, that he lost something he cherished from his military service\u2014the symbolic military issue Bausch & Lombs coveted by every officer who served. I wanted so badly to be my dad\u2019s Hero. I overturned every piece of furniture in the house, rifled every dresser drawer, every nook and crannie, underneath beds, the garage, the yard, you name it. I was on a Mission. I wanted to walk up to him and say, beaming, Here Dad! I found your sunglasses! But alas, after several weeks, no success. I was crushed by my own failure. He passed away, and his possessions were divided among our family. Fast forward to a few years ago. My Cocker Spaniel was sniffing around in the bathroom, and a box fell out of the bathroom closet with a crash. I went to investigate and chide the dog\u2026when the first thing I saw on the bathroom floor next to the overturned box was the yellowed leather case, and his wire rim sunglasses. I picked it up, held it in my hand, and I, a grown man, immediately burst into tears, sobbing. Suddenly, I was nineteen again. My wife asked what was the matter, and I told her the whole story. I figured after his passing, his sunglasses\u2014which evidently were in the house the whole time\u2014were probably tossed into one of many anonymous cardboard boxes, and I happened to be the one who carried off the box containing them. So here Dad! I found your sunglasses! I love you! Am I still your hero? What job does the author have? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. Accountant  B. Janitor  C.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Yorke said that the starting point for the record was the \"incredibly dense and terrifying sound\" of Bitches Brew, the 1970 avant-garde jazz fusion album by Miles Davis. He described the sound of Bitches Brew to Q: \"It was building something up and watching it fall apart, that's the beauty of it. It was at the core of what we were trying to do with OK Computer.\" Yorke identified \"I'll Wear It Proudly\" by Elvis Costello, \"Fall on Me\" by R.E.M., \"Dress\" by PJ Harvey and \"A Day in the Life\" by the Beatles as particularly influential on his songwriting. Radiohead drew further inspiration from the recording style of film soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone and the krautrock band Can, musicians Yorke described as \"abusing the recording process\". Jonny Greenwood described OK Computer as a product of being \"in love with all these brilliant records ... trying to recreate them, and missing.\"According to Yorke, Radiohead hoped to achieve an \"atmosphere that's perhaps a bit shocking when you first hear it, but only as shocking as the atmosphere on the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds.\" They expanded their instrumentation to include electric piano, Mellotron, cello and other strings, glockenspiel and electronic effects. Jonny Greenwood summarised the exploratory approach as \"when we've got what we suspect to be an amazing song, but nobody knows what they're gonna play on it.\" Spin characterised OK Computer as sounding like \"a DIY electronica album made with guitars\".Critics suggested a stylistic debt to 1970s progressive rock, an influence that Radiohead have disavowed. According to Andy Greene in Rolling Stone, Radiohead \"were collectively hostile to seventies progressive rock ... but that didn't stop them from reinventing prog from scratch on OK Computer, particularly on the six-and-a-half-minute 'Paranoid Android'.\" Writing in 2017, The New Yorker's Kelefa Sanneh said OK Computer \"was profoundly prog: grand and dystopian, with a lead single that was more than six minutes long.\"\n++++++++++\noutput: Radiohead\n\n\ninput: Please answer the following: What is the full name of the person who marries their boyfriend only months after their first meeting?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In Spring 1989, sisters, Alex, and Annie Morrell, finish prep school and return home to start college. Their mother, publishing heiress Anne Scripps, welcomes them in her New York mansion. Anne has recently divorced her husband Tony, and is still struggling with the divorce. Nonetheless, she is happy with her new boyfriend, much younger Scott Douglas, a volatile-tempered young man whom she marries only months after their first meeting. From the start, Alex is uncertain if she should trust Scott, having heard stories about a possible violent past. When Anne announces that she will be having a baby, Scott is distrustful to notice how Alex reacts with doubt about the news. To get rid of her, he claims that he has found marijuana in Alex's bedroom. Alex denies the accusation, but Anne defends her boyfriend, who forces Alex to leave the house. Shortly after Anne and Scott's baby, Tori's, birth in June 1990, Scott gets violent and beats up Anne for inviting Tony's family for the baby's coming out party. Alex and Annie encourage their mom to leave Scott, but Anne forgives him after a couple of months. By June 1991, she and Scott are a happy couple again. On Alex's 21st birthday, Scott lashes out at Anne again when he finds her smoking in the same room as Tori, and then throws a guest, Stacey, off the stairs. Enraged, Alex dares Scott to hit her, and the police interrupts their fight, only to have Scott lie about the situation. A similar occurrence takes place at a formal ball, where Scott pushes around Anne in front of her friends. As they leave, the fight continues in the car, and Scott eventually throws her out while speeding.\n++++++++++\noutput:"}], "response": "Anne Scripps"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content":

Article: Do you want to know how and why a fall leaf changes color? We first have to understand what leaves are and what they do. Leaves are the world's food factories. Plants take water from the ground through their roots and take CO2from the air. Plants use sunlight to turn water and CO2into glucose , a kind of sugar. Plants use it as food for energy and growing. A chemical called _ in the leaves gives plants their green colour. As summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter, and trees \"know\" to begin getting ready for winter. During winter, there is not enough sunlight or water. Trees rest during this time and live on the food they store during the summer. They begin to shut down their food-making factories. As the green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves, we begin to see yellow and orange leaves. The bright reds and purples we see in leaves are made mostly in autumn. In some trees, like maples , sunlight and the cool nights of autumn turn the glucose in the leaves into a red colour. And we can enjoy the beautiful red leaves during autumn.

Francisco Goya (Stellan Skarsg\u00c3\u00a5rd) is a renowned painter, who, among others, does portraits for the royal family as the Official Court Painter to the King and Queen. The Spanish Inquisition is disturbed by part of Goya's work. Brother Lorenzo Casamares (Javier Bardem) is hiring Goya to paint a portrait and defends him, saying that his works are not evil, they just show evil. He recommends the Church step up the fight against anti-Catholic practices. He requests and is put in charge of intensifying the Inquisition. When posing in Goya's studio, Lorenzo asks Goya about a young model he uses, In\u00c3\u00a9s (Natalie Portman), daughter of a rich merchant, Tom\u00c3\u00a1s Bilbat\u00c3\u00baa (Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Luis G\u00c3\u00b3mez) who also has a son named \u00c3\u0081ngel (Unax Ugalde). In\u00c3\u00a9s is spotted by Inquisition spies (trained by Lorenzo) declining a dish of pork in a tavern. The Holy Office of the Inquisition orders In\u00c3\u00a9s to come to the office. There she is arrested and accused of \"judaizing\", i.e. spreading Jewish rituals, because she did not eat pork the other evening. She is stripped naked and tortured by strappado (\"put to The Question\"), confesses, and is imprisoned. Naturally, the Inquisition's archives had already revealed that one of her father's ancestors had converted from Judaism to Christianity in 1624 upon arrival in Spain from Amsterdam.

Rafael sees his father Nino (H\u00c3\u00a9ctor Alterio) frequently but his friends rarely.

He now wants to sell the restaurant and move to southern Mexico and raise horses. At the same time his father wants to remarry his wife because they were never married in the Catholic Church.

Plot title: A History of Violence Movie plot: Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is a diner owner who lives in the small town of Millbrook, Indiana, with a loving wife Edie (Maria Bello), teenage son Jack (Ashton Holmes), and daughter Sarah. One night, two men attempt to rob the restaurant. When a waitress is threatened, Tom deftly kills both robbers with surprising skill and precision. He is hailed as a hero by his family and the townspeople, and the incident makes him a local celebrity. Tom is visited by scarred gangster Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris), who alleges that he is actually a gangster named Joey Cusack who had dealings with him in the Irish Mob in Philadelphia. Tom vehemently denies this, but Fogarty remains persistent and begins to stalk the Stall family. Under pressure from Fogarty and his newfound fame, Tom's relationships with his family become strained. Following an argument with his father over the use of violence on a bully at his school, Jack runs away. He is caught by Fogarty, who, with Jack as his hostage, goes with his men to the Stall house and demands that \"Joey\" return to Philadelphia with them. After the gangsters release Jack, Tom is slow to join them in their car, so they attempt to force him to cooperate. Tom kills the two henchmen with the same precision he used against the robbers, but Fogarty shoots Tom as Tom is aiming at him. As Fogarty is standing over Tom, preparing to kill him, Tom finally admits he is indeed Joey. However, before Fogarty can deliver a coup de gr\u00c3\u00a2ce, Jack kills Fogarty with a shotgun. At the hospital, Edie confronts Tom, claiming that while he was attacking Fogarty's men, she saw \"the real Joey\" that Fogarty was talking about. Tom shocks Edie by admitting that he is actually Joey Cusack, and that he has killed for both money and pleasure. He tells Edie that he ran away from Philadelphia to escape his violent criminal past.

He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome's major priesthoods, including that of pontifex maximus; as he invented none, he could claim them as traditional honours. His reforms were represented as adaptive, restorative and regulatory, rather than innovative; most notably his elevation (and membership) of the ancient Arvales, his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality. Augustus obtained the pax deorum, maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation. This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors.\".

By the beginning of the 20th century, the trans-Saharan trade had clearly declined because goods were moved through more modern and efficient means, such as airplanes, rather than across the desert.\".

Taking him to his luxury mansion in Beverly Hills, Stanwyk formally introduces himself and that he works for Boyd Aviation as the executive vice president Stanwyk claims to have bone cancer, with only months left to live, and wishes to avoid the pain and suffering.

Deborah\nAnswer:"}], "response": "The story is divided among three distinct time periods: the early 1920s, the early 1930s and the year 1968. The story is also jumps back and forth between these times and is summarized chronologically here.In 1968, David \"Noodles\" Aaronson (Robert De Niro), returns to the Lower East Side of Manhattan, NY following a prolonged absence. He has been called back to his old neighborhood under mysterious circumstances; he's received a notice from a local rabbi telling him that the cemetery in his old neighborhood is being closed and the remains of those buried there are being moved. He sets himself up in with a room in a bar owned by an old friend, Fat Moe (Larry Rapp), and begins to investigate the summons he received. Noodles is suspicious of the letter, thinking he's been called back to see to the reburial of his old friends, Patrick \"Patsy\" Goldberg (James Hayden), Philip \"Cockeye\" Stein (William Forsythe), and Max Bercovic (James Woods), who he used to be in a gang with. Noodles believes someone is seeking revenge against him.In the earliest time period, the early 1920s, the boys grow up in poverty in a Jewish neighborhood of the Lower East Side. They ostensibly work for a young local gangster named Bugsy, however, Noodles and his friends Patsy, Cockeye and Dominic, have ambitions to strike out on their own. One day, while attempting to roll a drunk, they are foiled in their plot by Max, who is just moving into the neighborhood with his mother. He keeps the drunk's pocket watch and leaves the boys to be harassed by a policeman, Whitey (whom the boys call \"Fartface\") who constantly bullies them.

Review: \"The Callender Papers\" is the third book I've read by Cynthia Voigt, and I was not disappointed. If you've read these types of stories before, then you could probably predict everything, but I admit to not figuring it out until more than halfway through the story. The writing is very sophisticated, and I as pleased that a young pre-teen girl was portrayed as someone who had a decent head on her shoulders. I would have liked a better explanation about Mr. Callender and the events that took place - I found that entire passage explained much too fast. Otherwise, this book is very enjoyable. I recommend.

After irradiation, rhEGF was administered subcutaneously at various doses (0.04, 0.2, 1.0, and 5.0 mg/kg/day) eight times at 2- to 3-day intervals. The evaluation methods included histologic changes of small intestinal mucosa, change in body weight, frequency of diarrhea, and survival rate.', 'The recovery of small intestinal mucosa after irradiation was significantly improved in the mice treated with a high dose of rhEGF. In the mice that underwent irradiation without rhEGF treatment, intestinal mucosal ulceration, mucosal layer damage, and severe inflammation occurred. The regeneration of villi was noticeable in mice treated with more than 0.2 mg/kg rhEGF, and the villi recovered fully in mice given more than 1 mg/kg rhEGF. The frequency of diarrhea persisting for more than 3 days was significantly greater in the radiation control group than in the rhEGF-treated groups.\nAnswer: Systemic administration of rhEGF accelerates recovery from mucosal damage induced by irradiation.

Title: Thank You for Smoking Movie plot: Nick Naylor is a handsome, smooth-talking tobacco lobbyist and the vice-president of a tobacco lobby called the \"Academy of Tobacco Studies\", which for 15 years has been \"researching\" the link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer. They claim that their research\u00e2\u0080\u0094funded primarily by tobacco companies\u00e2\u0080\u0094has found no definitive evidence of any linkage. Naylor's job consists mainly of reporting the questionable research of the \"Academy\" to the public and defending Big Tobacco on television programs by questioning opposing health claims and advocating personal choice. Naylor and his friends, firearm lobbyist Bobby Jay Bliss and alcohol lobbyist Polly Bailey, meet every week and jokingly call themselves the \"Merchants of Death\" or \"The MOD Squad\". As anti-tobacco campaigns mount and numbers of young smokers decline, Naylor suggests that product placement of cigarettes could once again boost cigarette sales. Naylor's boss, BR, sends Naylor to Los Angeles to bargain for cigarette placement in upcoming movies. Naylor takes along his young son Joey in hopes of bonding with him. The next day, Naylor is sent to meet with Lorne Lutch, the cancer-stricken man who once played the Marlboro Man in cigarette ads and is now campaigning against cigarettes. As his son watches, Naylor successfully offers Lutch a suitcase of money for his silence. During the drive back, Nick and Joey discuss the beauty of argument. Senator Finistirre, one of Naylor's most vehement critics, is the promoter of a bill to add a skull and crossbones POISON warning to cigarette packaging. During a televised debate with Finistirre, Naylor receives a death threat from a caller. Despite the threat, Naylor still plans to appear before a U.S. Senate committee to fight Finistirre's bill. Naylor is then kidnapped and covered in nicotine patches. Awakening in a hospital, he learns that the very high nicotine tolerance level resulting from his smoking has saved him from death by nicotine poisoning, but now he is hypersensitive to nicotine and can never smoke...\nA: Naylor\n\nQ: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Review: I got tired of buying cheap $5 can openers every 2 years from my local store and decided to look for a higher quality Stainless Steel one. I purchased the WMF after reading all the positive reviews. I decided to get this over a safety can opener since I use the cover to drain excess water out of the can for chicken breast.I noticed it is easy to handle and really smooth when cutting. I make an effort to rinse and dry off the can opener each time after use to prevent corrosion (yes it is still possible). I'm looking forward to using this for at least the next 10 years!

He arranged a visit to the US in spring 1972, and was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah, where he observed the canyon's distinctive colours and birdsong. The twelve-movement orchestral piece Des canyons aux \u00e9toiles... was the result, first performed in 1974 in New York.In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the Paris Op\u00e9ra. While reluctant to undertake such a major project, he was persuaded in 1975 to accept the commission and began work on his Saint-Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own libretto) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983. Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a \"spectacle\" rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so), but he continued to compose. In 1984 he published a major collection of organ pieces, Livre du Saint Sacrement; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra.In the summer of 1978, Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire. He was promoted to the highest rank of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, the Grand-Croix, in 1987. An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978, but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen's 80th included a complete performance in London's Royal Festival Hall of St. Fran\u00e7ois, which the composer attended, and Erato's publication of a seventeen-CD collection of Messiaen's music including a disc of the composer in...\n****\n[A]: Messiaen\n\n\n[Q]: What is the common last name of the person who moved to Paris in 1925?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz (French: [k\u025b\u0281t\u025bs]; 2 July 1894 \u2013 28 September 1985), born Kert\u00e9sz Andor, was a Hungarian-born photographer known for his groundbreaking contributions to photographic composition and the photo essay. In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kert\u00e9sz never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kert\u00e9sz pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kert\u00e9sz stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kert\u00e9sz decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known.  They are called the Hungarian period, the French period, the American period and, toward the end of his life, the International period.\n****\n[A]:"}], "response": "Kert\u00e9sz"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

Plot title: The Great Mouse Detective Movie plot: In London, circa 1897, a young mouse named Olivia Flaversham is celebrating her birthday with her toymaker father, Hiram. Suddenly, a bat with a crippled wing and peg leg bursts into the Flaversham's workshop, kidnapping Hiram. Olivia searches to find the famed Great Mouse Detective named Basil of Baker Street, but gets lost. A surgeon named Dr. David Q. Dawson, who is returning from a lengthy service of the Mouse Queen's 66th Regiment in Afghanistan, stumbles upon Olivia, and escorts Olivia to Basil's residence. Upon their arrival at his residence, Basil is initially indifferent, but when Olivia mentions the peg-legged bat that kidnapped her father, Basil realizes that Olivia saw Fidget, a henchman of Professor Ratigan, a villain Basil has been trying to arrest for years. It is then revealed that Professor Ratigan kidnapped Hiram to create a clockwork robot which mimics the Queen of the Mice so Ratigan can rule England. Hiram initially refuses to participate in the scheme, but gives in when Ratigan threatens to harm Olivia. Ratigan then announces his plans to kill the Queen and become \"supreme ruler of all mousedom\" to his henchmen. Meanwhile, as Basil is deducing the case, Fidget appears through the window, scaring Olivia. They give chase as Basil finds Fidget's footprints, declaring that they purse him in order to find Hiram. Basil, along with Dawson and Olivia, takes Toby, Sherlock Holmes's pet Basset Hound, to track Fidget's scent, where they locate him in a toyshop stealing clockwork mechanisms and toy soldiers' uniforms. Fidget then ambushes Olivia from inside a toy cradle and kidnaps her. Basil and Dawson pursue Fidget, but become entangled and fall behind. While searching the shop, Dawson discovers Fidget's checklist, to which Basil does some chemical tests to discover the list came from a riverfront near the Thames. Basil and Dawson disguise themselves as sailors and go into a tavern called the \"Rat Trap\" and follow Fidget to Ratigan's headquarters. They are caught, and Ratigan has his hooligans tie...

Plot title: Eastern Promises Movie plot: Anna Khitrova, a British-Russian midwife at a London hospital, finds a Russian-language diary on the body of Tatiana, a 14-year-old girl who dies in childbirth. She also finds a card for the Trans-Siberian Restaurant, which is owned by Semyon, an old vor in the Russian Mafia. Anna thus sets out to track down the girl's family so that she can find a home for the baby girl, having meetings with Semyon, whom she initially regards as friendly. Anna's mother Helen does not discourage her, but Anna's Russian uncle and self-described former KGB officer, Stepan, whom Anna asks for help with the translation of the diary, urges caution. Through translation of the diary, Anna comes to learn that Semyon and his ignorant, unstable son Kirill had abused the girl, addicted her to heroin, forced her into prostitution, and raped her. Ultimately, Anna realizes that the baby was fathered by Semyon (in several scenes it is made clear that Kirill is impotent and never had sex with Tatiana). Kirill's driver is Nikolai Luzhin, who also serves as the family \"cleaner\", dumping murdered bodies in the River Thames. Through Nikolai, Semyon, fearing prosecution, promises to give the location of the girl's family to Anna if she hands back the diary. Nikolai takes the diary but does not give a location, instead urging Anna to keep the baby in London. Semyon distrusts Anna's uncle Stepan and orders Nikolai to kill him. Nikolai accepts and soon Stepan goes missing. As Nikolai's star rises within the vory, an impressed Semyon sponsors him as a full member, due in part to Nikolai's protection of Semyon's incompetent son, who authorized a hit on a rival Chechen vory leader with the help of a Kurdish associate, Azim. The hit was ill-advised and not approved by Semyon. Two Chechen hitmen soon arrive in London seeking vengeance and kill Azim's mentally handicapped nephew who also took part in the hit.

Plot title: Inside Man Movie plot: Dalton Russell (Clive Owen), seated in what appears to be a jail cell, opens the film with a prologue about having carried out the \"perfect robbery\". A team of masked robbers, dressed as painters who call each other by variants of the name \"Steve\", seize control of a Manhattan bank and take the employees and patrons hostage. They divide the hostages into groups and hold them in different rooms. Additionally, they take all of the hostages' clothes and dress everyone in jumpsuits and masks identical to those of the robbers. This way, the robbers and hostages will be indistinguishable to the police. Police surround the bank and detectives Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) take charge of the negotiations. Russell, the leader of the robbers, demands food. The police supply pizzas whose boxes include listening devices; these pick up a language which the police finally identify as Albanian. However, they discover that the conversations are just old propaganda recordings of the deceased Albanian communist dictator Enver Hoxha; it becomes clear that the robbers anticipated surveillance. After being informed of the robbery, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), the chairman of the board of directors and founder of the bank, hires \"fixer\" Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) to try to protect the contents of his safe deposit box within the bank. White, with assistance from the Mayor of New York City, arranges a conversation with Russell, who allows her to enter the bank and inspect the contents of the box, which include documents from Nazi Germany. Russell implies that Case started his bank with money that he received from the Nazis for unspecified services, resulting in the deaths of many Jewish people during World War II. White tells Russell that Case will pay him a substantial sum to destroy the contents of the box.

We soon found ourselves at Blue Gum Corner, a place named after the huge old blue gum tree that stood by there, a well-known local landmark. It stands at a minor crossroad leading to our town. The trunk is tall and smooth with no handholds for climbing. About six metres from the ground the first branch sticks out over the road. We parked beneath the huge old tree and discussed what we might do. All of a sudden we hit upon an idea -- a hanging! I was chosen as \"hangee\". The plan was quite simple. As I stood upon the roof of the car, the rope   was threaded down my jacket through my collar and down one leg of my jeans. I put my foot through the loop at the bottom. There I hung, still. The boys rolled about laughing until, a car, I hear a car! Before they ran to hide in the nearby field, they gave me a good push so that \"the body\" would swing as the car drove by. To our disappointment, the car simply turned off for town without even slowing. The boys came out of their hiding places and we discussed the situation. Surely they had seen me, hadn't they? Then we heard another car. The act was repeated, but still without any obvious reaction. We played the game about five or six times, but as no one seemed to notice, we abandoned the trick. What we did not know was that every car that had passed had unquestionably seen \"the body\" and each one, too scared to stop, had driven directly to the local Police Station.

Article: I like watching TV very much, for I think it has many advantages . First of all, watching TV is a good rest(;). After a day of hard work, we need a good rest. Watching TV can make our mind and body not tired any more because of the pleasant music and TV plays. Besides , watching TV is entertaining . There are many kinds of entertainment, such as sports activities, singing and dancing, plays and films all over the world at every time. It's not possible  for us to go to every place to enjoy all the activities within a short time. We need at least over ten hours to fly from New York to Paris, a week by train from Beijing to Moscow and an hour to drive from Queens District to Manhattan District.)But within just one second, TV can bring us from an NBA game in New York to a fashion show in Paris by changing the channels . Most importantly, watching TV is educational. Our children can learn every kind of subjects through the educational programs and the special reports on TV, and it's easy for them to learn Chinese from a Chinese teacher in Beijing and to learn Russian lessons from a Russian teacher in Moscow. At the same time, a teacher can teach quite a lot of students without a large classroom. Question: According to the writer what is the most important reason for watching TV? - We can learn something useful. - Watching TV is a good rest. - We can see whatever we like. - We can enjoy ourselves.\n(A).\n"}], "response": "We can learn something useful."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Problem: Which common wildflower has the Latin name Bellis Perennis?\n======\nA: daisy\n\n\nQ: Owned by the Mondadori arm of the Berlusconi empire, which women's weekly fashion magazine was established in Italy in 1938 with its British edition starting in 2005?\nA: grazia\n\n\nProblem: What spoken word competition, which has been organised for many years by Gary Hallock, has been held every May since 1978 in Austin, Texas?\nAnswer: o henry pun off\n\n\nQ: George Fox was the founder of which religious grouping?\n-----\nA: quakers\n\n\nQ: Who in 1588, commanded the English fleet that confronted the Spanish Armada?\nWhat is the answer?\n\nA: lord howard of effingham\n\n\nProblem: Which composer, born in 1732, wrote the oratorios 'The Creation' and 'The Seasons'?\nAnswer:"}], "response": "franz josef haydn"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "[Q]: \"About Green PWGSC Fleet Activities Once again, PWGSC has exceeded its obligations under the Alternative Fuels Act, thereby making another significant contribution to the reduction of harmful emissions from its vehicle fleet.\" --> French?\n[A]: Concernant l'\u00e9cologisation du parc automobile de TPSGC Encore une fois, TPSGC a d\u00e9pass\u00e9 l obligations qu'il devait remplir en vertu de la Loi sur les carburants de remplacement et contribu\u00e9 sensiblement \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction des \u00e9missions nocives produites par son parc automobile.\n\n[Q]: \"Ultrastructural observations on the feeding techniques of the protostelids Ceratiomyxella tahitiensis, Nematostelium gracile, and Schizoplasmodium cavostelioides are presented.\" --> French?\n[A]: Les auteurs pr\u00e9sentent des observations ultrastructurales sur les m\u00e9thodes selon lesquelles s'alimentent les protost\u00e9lides Ceratiomyxella tahitiensis, Nematostelium gracile et Schizoplasmodium cavostelioides.\n\n[Q]: \"Scroll down the page until you find information about the Canada/USA boundary.\" --> French?\n[A]:"}], "response": "D\u00e9filez vers le bas jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que vous trouviez de l\u2019information sur la fronti\u00e8re entre le Canada et les \u00c9tats-Unis."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Given the question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

Well, I guess this really does prove they are only a side-show. Eminem has different production, so the group will have different production. Eminem went more serious, now the group is more serious.Besides that, Shady himself (or what is left of what he use to be) is basically a no-show. In any track Eminem's in, it's usually the strongest, and that is the case here; However, that doesn't mean he was great. That means the CD itself is misconfusion, contradiction, and a side-show for Eminem's next CD (\"Encore\", which was better then this, but not that great overall, as well).D-12 is the commercials to the Eminem Show, everyone's just waiting to get in between them.

A bank card belonging to him was also found in the roof lining of the Volkswagen Sharan driven by the killers.\nMr Abdi was gunned down in what is understood to have been a feud over drugs and he died from a gunshot wound to the chest.\nIain McSporran, prosecuting, said: \"The Crown's position is that there appears to have been an organised crime group consisting largely of Somalian males with London connections, operating in Glasgow and Edinburgh. \"\nThey split into two rival factions shortly before the murder. Two days before the fatal shooting a message was sent saying: \"The guns are coming out.\"\nOn May 26, 2013 the Sharan with the killers on board chased the Ford Focus containing Mr Abdi and his associates through the streets of Edinburgh.\nIt ended with the Sharan crashed into fencing beside a tennis court. After Mr Abdi  got out the Focus and was striking the rear of the Sharan with a baseball bat, he was shot with a sub-machine pistol from within the car.\nThe court heard that five shots were discharged from the machine gun before it jammed. Three of them hit Abdi - the fatal shot was through the chest.\nThe Crown's position is that it is not possible to say who fired the fatal shot. Ahmed was convicted of murder on an art and part basis.\nDet Supt Kenny Graham, of Police Scotland, said: \"The murder of Mohammed Abdi was a brutal killing and those involved showed absolutely no regard for human life or the safety of others in the area.\n\"Such incidents are thankfully extremely rare in Scotland and it is completely incomprehensible why these men chose a quiet suburban area of the capital to carry out such a barbaric act.\n\"Our investigation has been extensive and involved specialised officers working with authorities from other countries as well as across the UK.\"\nIn April and May last year, seven of the nine men accused of the murder of Mr Abdi appeared at the High Court in Glasgow.\nDuring the trial Mohamud, 30, Huseen, 23, and Ali, 26, changed their pleas to guilty and the remaining accused had their pleas of not guilty accepted.\n\n\nWrite an article based on this summary:\n\nAbout 2,500 traffic police officers will be on London's streets during rush hours following the deaths of six cyclists over 14 days.\n+++++++\nA:"}], "response": "Operation Safeway will see Metropolitan Police officers deployed at 166 key junctions where they will issue fixed penalty notices to people breaking road traffic laws.\nAbout 650 officers will be at 60 sites across London on Monday.\nThere have been 14 cyclist deaths in London this year, nine involving HGVs.\nThe officers will also be offering advice to anyone seen putting themselves or other road uses at risk.

Making matters worse, the team removed All-Pro safety Troy Polamalu from the game in the fourth quarter after experiencing what Tomlin called \"concussion-like symptoms.\"\n\nAnother mixed bag from the Steelers, who struggled to put consecutive solid performances together.\n\n\"We just have to be consistent,\" wide receiver Hines Ward said. \"We are not doing it on a consistent level yet. But we're getting there.\"\n\nSo perhaps is Jacksonville, even if the team's five-game losing streak matches the franchise's longest in a decade.\n\nMaurice Jones-Drew rushed for 96 yards and a day after celebrating his 22nd birthday, rookie quarterback Blaine Gabbert shook off five sacks to complete 12 of 26 passes for 109 yards and a touchdown. He put the Jaguars in a position to win it with a last-second heave that sailed harmlessly to the back of the end zone.\n\n\"We had chances to score,\" Gabbert said. \"We've got to come out with more energy in the first half and play the game, start off the game, like we did in the second half, having that sense of urgency.\"\n\nInstead it was the Steelers who had the urgency early, racing to a 17-0 lead behind running back Rashard Mendenhall, who sat out last week's 38-17 romp over Tennessee with a balky hamstring.\n\nReserves Jonathan Dwyer and Issac Redman played so well in Mendenhall's absence, Tomlin said he'd likely split carries this week. Mendenhall, however, reminded Tomlin why he's topped 1,000 yards each of the last two seasons, rolling up 146 yards and a touchdown while running with a purpose.\n\nCriticized for dancing too much at times, Mendenhall ripped off a career-best 68-yard run in the second quarter, part of an dominant half in which Pittsburgh outgained the Jaguars 315-68.\n\n\"We felt like we could have had a very explosive, productive day offensively, running and throwing the ball,\" quarterback Ben Roethlisberger said. \"It's frustrating it didn't finish up that way.\"\n\nRoethlisberger threw for 200 yards and a touchdown, but completed just one pass in the second half while getting sacked three times.\n\n\"(We) just played sloppy at first and then we made up our minds, settled down and stopped them,\" Jacksonville defensive end Jeremy Mincey said.\n\nThe Jaguars had a little help from the Steelers.\n\nA roughing-the-punter penalty on Jacksonville's first drive of the second half gave the Jaguars a first down they eventually turned into an 18-yard touchdown from Gabbert to Jason Hill to bring them within 17-10.\n\nThe holes Mendenhall ran through so easily in the first half disappeared, and the Jaguars kept on coming. They drove to the Pittsburgh 27 with just over 4 minutes to play.\n\nGabbert remained on the field on fourth-and-6 before coach Jack Del Rio reconsidered and sent on kicker Josh Scobee, who drilled a 45-yarder to cut the deficit to four.\n\n\"We went out for the look to take our shot there (and) didn't like the play,\" Del Rio said. \"Blaine did a good job of not forcing it.\"\n\nRoethlisberger, playing with a special protective shoe on his sprained left foot for a second straight game, scrambled for a first down,but the Steelers couldn't run out the clock.\n\nJacksonville got the ball back at its 23 with 1:01 to play and Gabbert showcased why the Jaguars took him with the 10th pick in this year's draft. He shook off a first-down sack to move Jacksonville, which came in last in the league in total yards and yards passing and 31st in points, to the Pittsburgh 48 with 2 seconds to go.\n\nHis desperation pass fell harmlessly to the turf and the Steelers escaped.\n\n\"If you get out to a 17-point lead and get comfortable, you take it off their throat,\" Pittsburgh wide receiver Mike Wallace said. \"We have to keep the same intensity the whole game. We started out with a lot of intensity and then we fell off a little bit.\"\n\nThe Steelers travel to Arizona next week before a critical two-game homestand against New England and Baltimore.\n\n\"The big challenges lie ahead,\" Tomlin said. \"We need to prepare for them.\"\n\nNotes: Ward caught three passes for 47 yards to move past Michael Irvin and into 19th place on the yards receiving list. Ward now has 11,939 yards. \u2026 New Jacksonville punter Nick Harris, signed last week, averaged 42.3 yards on seven punts. \u2026 Scobee's two field goals gave him field goals in 14 straight games, a team record. \u2026 Pittsburgh G Doug Legursky left in the second quarter with a dislocated toe.\nPlease write a summary below.\n"}], "response": "Rashard Mendenhall ran for a season-high 146 yards and a touchdown and the Steelers narrowly avoided a second-half collapse in a 17-13 over Jacksonville."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "\u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e \"Beyond The Fantasy\" \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0432 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u0435, \u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0437\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b \u043e\u0436\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432.\n\nWhich language is this?\n\nLanguage: Russian\n\n\n\u0418\u041c\u0417 \u2013 \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u2013 \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0441\u0448\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441 \u043e\u043f\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438.\n\nWhich language is this?\n\nLanguage: Russian\n\n\n\u041e\u0441\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u0441\u043c\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044b \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u0445 \u0432 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u043b\u0438\u0446\u043e\u043c \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0441\u0430.\n\nWhich language is this?\n\nLanguage: Russian\n\n\n\u0414\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0430\u0442\u0435\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\n\nWhich language is this?\n\nLanguage:"}], "response": "Russian"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Translate to French:\nThe amount of the lump sum payment for the pay in lieu cannot exceed the maximum of that which he or she would have received had they chosen Option (b), the Transition Support Measure.\n\nAnswer: Le montant forfaitaire de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration en remplacement de la p\u00e9riode exc\u00e9dentaire ne peut pas d\u00e9passer le maximum que l'employ\u00e9 aurait touch\u00e9 s'il avait choisi l'option b), la Mesure de soutien \u00e0 la transition.\n\n\nTranslate to French:\nThe requests relate to programme 1, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference management;

That's right: \"The Killing,\" a show that's been canceled twice, is coming back to life for a second time. AMC axed \"The Killing\" after its second season last year, only to pick it up again after talks between the studio and Netflix sparked interest in another round. The third season aired this summer on AMC to fairly modest ratings (ending with 1.5 million viewers).

Siding with the Obama administration over Congress on a 2002 law, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that the 6-3 decision that the Constitution confers authority on the President to recognize foreign governments.\n\n\u201cRecognition is an act with immediate and powerful significance for international relations, so the President\u2019s position must be clear. Congress cannot require him to contradict his own statement regarding a determination of formal recognition,\u201d Justice Kennedy said. The court\u2019s four liberal justices, including its only three Jewish members, all sided with the Obama administration.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Samuel Alito dissented, arguing that the other justices irrationally feared that the world might misinterpret the passport change to mean that America\u2019s foreign policy in the Middle East had also changed.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is a first,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cNever before has this court accepted a President\u2019s direct defiance of an act of Congress in the field of foreign affairs.\u201d\n\nThe case was brought by the parents of Menachem B.

Bush signed the bill, but Bush said he would ignore the section that would allow Jerusalem-born citizens to change their birthplace to Israel.

Apparently Bill has only sent two e-mails in his life \u2014 and neither of them to Hillary.\n\nRead MoreHillary's email issue has legs\n\nThere's also a dog-ate-my-homework quality to this Clinton episode, with Hillary saying: Sorry, I deleted the remaining 30,000 or so e-mails, so I just can't show them to you.\n\nBut those e-mails are out there in some cloud, or in some hard drive, or somewhere else. And Hillary has plainly stonewalled any proposals to have an independent counsel cull through the remaining e-mails.\n\nFrankly, I don't believe any part of that story \u2014 how many e-mails she sent to the State Department, or how many are left. Just not credible.\n\nRead MoreThe Apple Watch launch says a lot about Apple's bet on China\n\nAnd this whole deletion thing is so Nixonian.

Do you know how they were invented and developed? Glasses took a long time to develop into what you can find in the glasses store today. The Chinese first used colored glasses as fashion. They thought that those glasses had magic, but they didn't think that glasses could help eyes to see clearly. In 1262, the inventor, Roger Bacon, discovered the amazing function  of lenses , and he thought that glasses could be used to help people to see. Twenty years later, in Florence, Italy, the inventor, Alessandro di Spina, made the first pair of glasses that could help people to see. Although these glasses worked, scientists didn't understand how glasses helped eyes to see. They thought that eyes sent out light onto whatever a person was looking at, and then the light came back to the eyes. Johannes Kepler finally found out how glasses worked. Inventors continued to improve glasses. In 1784, Ben Franklin created glasses that had bifocal  lenses. Many years later, in 1827, George Airy made circle-shaped glasses to correct _ , an eye problem that stops the eyes from seeing things clearly.

He can only see two minutes ahead, with the exception of a vision he once had of a woman walking into a diner. Knowing no details other than the time, he goes to the diner twice each day at 8:09 to await her arrival. He works as a small-time magician in Las Vegas, where he supplements his income with gambling, using his powers to win against the house.Cris draws the attention of FBI agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore), who has figured out his ability and wants to stop terrorists from detonating a nuclear weapon. Before she can approach Cris, his gambling draws the attention of casino security. He stops an imminent robbery, yet is chased by security agents. Using his ability to forecast the actions of his pursuers, he eludes them and the Las Vegas police, meanwhile foiling an attempted murder at the casino cash desk. Ferris tracks Cris to his home, but he escapes after foreseeing her arrival. Later that night, the casino's security chief is approached by two of the terrorists, is interrogated about Johnson and is then killed.The following morning, Cris is at the diner again when he sees Liz Cooper (Jessica Biel), the woman from his vision. It turns out that not only can Cris see the future, but he can also see how his actions can affect that future. After envisioning different approaches\u00e2\u0080\u0094all of which fall flat\u00e2\u0080\u0094he intervenes when Liz's ex-boyfriend arrives. Knowing that she is heading for Flagstaff, Arizona, Cris charms her into giving him a ride. Ferris follows, while the terrorists decide to kill him. A washed-out road forces Cris and Liz to spend the night in a motel. With the weapon tracked to Los Angeles, Ferris convinces her superiors to let her bring Cris in. The terrorists follow in the hope that the agents will lead them to Cris.Ferris confronts Liz near the hotel. Claiming Cris is a dangerous sociopath, Ferris asks Liz to drug Cris so that they can bring him in peacefully. Instead, Liz warns Cris, who tells her his secret. When she asks why he will not help the FBI stop the terrorists, he explains his limitations, noting the exception for events involving her. Asking for Liz to wait for him, he tries to escape from the FBI agents but is captured after saving Ferris from logs tumbling down the side of a mountain. Unable to kill Cris, the terrorists kidnap Liz instead.In custody, Cris is strapped to a chair with his eyes held open and forced to watch television until he has a vision that can help the FBI. They expect him to see a report about the detonation of the bomb, but instead he envisions a broadcast from several hours in the future in which Liz is killed by a small bomb while strapped to a wheelchair as bait for him. Cris escapes from captivity and races to the parking garage where she will be killed. Pursuing him to the garage, Ferris promises to help save her as long as Cris will help stop the bomb; she also sets up a plan to draw out the terrorists.Using his ability, Cris helps the FBI track the terrorists to the port where they are based. When they arrive, Cris is able to walk right up to the terrorist leader and avoid being hit, by seeing where the bullets will go and dodging them. After killing the terrorists and saving Liz, they find that the bomb has already been moved. Ferris shows Cris a seismograph, hoping that he will see any tremors caused by explosions before they happen. As he stares at the screen he realizes that he has made a mistake and that he was too late: the bomb detonates out at sea and completely destroys the port, as well as the rest of the city.The timeline reverts to Cris and Liz in bed at the hotel in Arizona, before Liz goes outside to be confronted by Ferris. Because of Liz's involvement in events, Cris has been able to envision everything that could happen leading to the nuclear explosion. \"Every time you look into the future, it changes.\"Cris calls Ferris and offers to help prevent the nuclear disaster, then asks Liz to wait for him., Question: Who helped the FBI ?\nA:"}], "response": "Answer: Cris"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "[Q]: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Their cheery song brightens many a winter's day. But robins are in danger of wearing themselves out by singing too much. Robins are singing all nightas well as during the day, British-based researchers say. David Dominoni, of Glasgow University, said that light from street lamps, takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clock, leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni, who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns, said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk. His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab, it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day. And the more birds are exposed to light, the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference, \"There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing. Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy. So by increasing their song output, there might be some costs of energy.\" And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light. Blackoiids and seagulls are also being more nocturnal. Dr Dominoni said, \"In Glasgow where I live, gulls are a serious problem. I have people coming to me saying `You are the bird expert. Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breeding season, between April and June, they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.\" Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution, other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise. However, some birds thrive in noisy environments. A study from California Polytechnic University found more hummingbirds in areas with heavy industrial machinery. It is thought that they are capitalising on their predators fleeing to quieter areas.\n****\n[A]: Question: Why do some birds thrive in noisy environments?Options:A Because there are fewer dangers.B Because there is more food to eat.C Because there is less light pollutionD Because there are more places to take shelter.Answer:A\n\n\n[Q]: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: People around the world are superstitious about numbers; even those ancient Greeks believed that all numbers and their multiples had some mystical significance. Those numbers between 1 and 13 were in particular to have a powerful influence over the affairs of men. For example, _ . The arrival of a letter will be followed by two others within a certain period. Another belief involving the number three has it that it is unlucky to light three cigarettes from the one match. If this happens, the bad luck that goes with the deed falls upon the person whose cigarette was the last to be lit. The ill-men linked to the lighting of three things from one match or candle goes back to at least the 17th century and probably earlier. It was believed that three candles alight at the same time would be sure to bring bad luck; one, two, or four, were permissible, but never just three. Seven was another significant number, usually regarded as a bringer of good luck. The ancient astrologers believed that the universe was governed by seven planets; students of Shakespeare will recall that the life of man was divided into seven ages. Seven horseshoes nailed to a house will protect it from all evil. Nine is usually thought of as a lucky number because it is the product of three times three. It was much used by the Anglo Saxons in their charms for healing. Another belief was that great changes occurred every 7th and 9th of a man's life. Consequently, the age of 63 (the product of nine and seven) was thought to be a very _ time for him. If he survived his 63rd year he might hope to live to a ripe old age. Thirteen, as we well know, is regarded with great awe and fear. The common belief is that this derives from the fact that there were 13 people at Christ's Last Supper. This being the eve of his betrayal, it is not difficult to understand the significance given to the number by the early Christians. In more modern times 13 is an especially unlucky number of a dinner party, for example.

Question: Who originally had the idea behind how plant life forms are viewed today? Context: The discipline of plant ecology was pioneered in the late 19th century by botanists such as Eugenius Warming, who produced the hypothesis that plants form communities, and his mentor and successor Christen C. Raunki\u00e6r whose system for describing plant life forms is still in use today. The concept that the composition of plant communities such as temperate broadleaf forest changes by a process of ecological succession was developed by Henry Chandler Cowles, Arthur Tansley and Frederic Clements. Clements is credited with the idea of climax vegetation as the most complex vegetation that an environment can support and Tansley introduced the concept of ecosystems to biology. Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, Nikolai Vavilov (1887\u20131943) produced accounts of the biogeography, centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants.\n++++++++++\noutput:"}], "response": "Warming"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Title: Beware this is Vol.2, and each vol has 8+ episodes Review: If you want loved Vol1, disk 1, search for Vol1, disk 2 (hard to find) to get the next set of baby words.

Title: Gorky Park Movie plot: Three young people are seen ice skating in Gorky Park. Three days later, Soviet militsiya officer Arkady Renko (William Hurt) investigates the discovery of their bodies a short distance from the skating rink. All have been shot in the chest and mouth; their faces and fingerprints have been completely removed. Renko is left anxious and paranoid when the KGB refuse to take over the investigation. Renko enlists the help of Professor Andreev (Ian McDiarmid) to reconstruct their faces. At a weekend getaway at the dacha of Chief Prosecutor Iamskoy (Ian Bannen), Renko makes the acquaintance of the American sable importer Jack Osborne (Lee Marvin) and his girlfriend Irina Asanova (Joanna Pacu\u00c5\u0082a). During his investigation, Renko crosses paths with William Kirwill (Brian Dennehy), a New York detective who is in the Soviet Union investigating the disappearance of his brother James. Renko is eventually able to piece together the victims' identities: James Kirwill, and two young Russians who were friends of Irina. He discovers that the three were busy constructing a chest for Osborne. Renko's suspicion of Osborne mounts over time, during their polite but tense conversations in social settings. When Irina is attacked by a KGB officer who attempts to inject her with a fatal overdose, Renko saves her. Nursing her back to health in his apartment, they begin an affair. Kirwill finally locates the barn where the three victims were building Osborne's chest. It was designed to smuggle six sables out of the country and to break the Soviet monopoly on their fur, potentially earning Osborne millions. Irina stubbornly continues to believe that her friends are alive. Osborne had promised to smuggle them out of Soviet Union in return for their work; he tells Irina that they were successfully freed. Renko confronts her with Prof. Andreev's reconstructed head of one of her friends, forcing her to realize that they have been murdered by Osborne. She confesses the full details of the plot to him and then runs away.

The 12 had quit  Yameen \u2019s ruling party last year  and allowing them to return to the legislature would deprive him of a majority.\nThe crisis poses the biggest threat to  Yameen \u2019s control of the Maldives since he took power in 2013  defeating Nasheed in an election that Nasheed\u2019s supporters say was rigged.\n Yameen  has stopped short of saying  he  will not obey the court order to free  his  opponents.  He  told a party meeting on Saturday  he  \u201cdid not expect the Supreme Court ruling at all\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve started dialogue with the Supreme Court. We\u2019ve sat and started talking about difficulties or concerns the state has \u201d  he  said. \u201cWe\u2019re working on making sure we can respect the court order in a way that doesn\u2019t cause any difficulties to the people.\u201d\n He  fired the chief of police on Thursday shortly after the court order was handed down  and on Saturday  he  fired the acting police chief  he  had chosen to replace  him .\nThe Maldives  an Indian Ocean island chain of around 400 000 people known to outsiders mainly as a tropical paradise for the tourists that provide most of its foreign exchange income  has experienced political unrest since  Yameen  took power.\n Yameen  is the half brother of Maumoon Abdul Gayoom  who ruled the Maldives for three decades until losing an election to Nasheed in 2008.  Yameen  and Gayoom have since had a falling out and Gayoom is now aligned with the opposition.\nA:"}], "response": "Pressure rises on Maldives leader to obey court order to free jailed foes"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "La d\u00e9signation \u2013 au moyen des lettres \u00ab C \u00bb, \u00ab S \u00bb et \u00ab R \u00bb \u2013 d'une parcelle de terre vis\u00e9e par le r\u00e8glement est faite uniquement par souci de commodit\u00e9 et ne produit aucun effet juridique.\n\nWhich language is this?\n"}], "response": "French"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are given a statement written in Telugu.

Article: The Erie Canal was the first important national waterway built in the US. It crossed New York from Buffalo on Lake Erie Troy to Albany on the Hudson River. It joined the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean. The canal served as a route over which industrial goods could flow into the west, and materials could pour into the east. The Erie Canal helped New York develop into the nation's largest city. The building of the canal was paid for entirely by the state of New York. It cost $ 7 143 789, but it soon gained its price many times over. Between 1825, when the canal was opened, and 1882, when toll charges  were stopped, the state collected $121 461 891. For a hundred years before the Erie was built, people had been talking about a canal which could join the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. The man who planned the Erie Canal and carried the plan through was De Witt Clinton. Those who were against the canal laughingly called it \"Clinton's Ditch \". Clinton talked and wrote about the canal and drew up plans for it. He and Governor Morris went to Washington in 1812 to ask for help for the canal, but they were unsuccessful. Clinton became governor of New York in 1817, and shortly afterwards, on July 4, 1817, broke ground for the canal in Rome, N.Y. The first part of the canal was completed in 1820. As the canal grew, towns along its course developed fast. The length of the canal is 363 miles. Question: We can see that the Erie Canal   _  .

Article: Stubbornness(,) can push a business to hold on but can also kill your business if it keeps stopping you. Because I'm stubborn. I chased my dream of creating a pet-food company that sells what it claims to sell and not some unidentifiable substance in a dressed-up bag. Originally we packed our foods in transparent bags, which became our guiding philosophy. To start the company in 2003, I visited every pet-food store in Manhattan and some outside the city. By 2006 Stella&Chewy's was sold in 250 stores, mostly in New York City. In 2007 I moved the company to Wisconsin, with our earnings reaching almost $500,000 that year.But getting my product into stores was just the beginning. We were competing against much bigger pet-food companies whose monthly marketing budgets were more than our yearly sales. So we invested in advertisements and a website and even stood on sidewalks giving our samples. With more customers came more feedback  , much of which I ignored, I was also receiving complaints about ice crystals   on the food, which form when the air temperature changes during transport. For this reason, most frozen foods are packaged in opaque   bags or boxes. Studies have proved that ice crystals have little effect on either the quality or the taste of the food. So I ignored the complaints. After all, we were better than our competitors that wouldn't even show their products. We didn't hide anything. In 2007 our sales kept growing, but not as fast as those of our competitors. We were told that new consumers were choosing products packaged in opaque bags. When I visited the stores and forced myself to consider my products objectively, I had to degree: The ice crystals reduced the look I wanted. The food looked as if a snowstorm had hit the inside of the bag. We switched to opaque bags and tried to make ice crystals smaller. Customers responded: In 2009 Stella$Chewy's was sold in 2,500 stores across the country. Question: At the beginning, the author's company packaged their foods in transparent bags to   _  .

Article: Paris Passengers carried per day: 4.4m Cost of ticket: 80p flat fare Length: 131 miles    Lines: 14   Stations: 297 In Paris there are pleasures for those who use the Metro  -- many of them artistic. The graceful Art Nouveau dragon-fly entrances are just the most noticeable on a Metro system which celebrated its 100thanniversary by spending 30 million francs (PS2.9million) on making its stations works of art. On my way home I pass Bonne Nouvelle station in the heart of Paris's cinema district. There, during the cinema festival this summer, special lighting effects dot the platforms and films are projected onto the large advertising boards. More than anything the metro is efficient. \"When I worked on line 4\", says a retired driver, \"we had exactly 30 minutes and 15 seconds to complete the journey. If it took any longer, they cut our pay.\" But there are problems. Many Metro stations have too many stairs, and changing lines at big interchanges  can be tiresome. Moscow Passengers carried per day: 9m Cost of ticket: 12p Length: 164 miles    Lines: 11   Stations: 162 The first underground passage for the Moscow Metropolitan started in 1932. Three years later the trains started running. They haven't stopped since-- every 90 seconds or two minutes during rush hour, every five minutes the rest of the time, from 6 a.m. till 1 a. m. There may be a crowd of people but there is seldom a wait. The trains take you through spacious and spotless stations. For tourists it's a major sightseeing attraction: from Russian Art Deco to neo-classical, the Metro stations are not to be missed. Tokyo Passengers carried per day: 7m Cost of ticket: 90p ~ PS1.68 Length: 177 miles    Lines: 12   Stations: 209 Trains do not just arrive on time in Tokyo.

The city was the centre of rangaku, the study of Western science, and it was here that physicians Jan Karel van den Broek and J. L. C. Pompe van Meerdervoort were instrumental in teaching their Japanese students not only medicine but also chemistry and photography. Neither Van den Broek nor Pompe van Meerdervoort was an experienced photographer, and their attempts to produce photographs were largely failures. Nevertheless, in turn they taught wet-collodion process photography to Keisai Yoshio, Furukawa Shumpei, Kawano Teiz\u014d, Maeda Genz\u014d, Ueno Hikoma, and Horie Kuwajir\u014d, among others.On his arrival in Japan, Rossier presumably introduced himself as a photographer despatched to Japan by Negretti and Zambra, perhaps thereby inspiring a misconception, for while he remained in the country he was often referred to as an \"English\" photographer. In Nagasaki, Rossier was assisted in his work by Maeda Genz\u014d, who had been instructed to accompany the \"Englishman\" and to further learn photography. With Maeda and other students escorting him around the city, Rossier took photographs of priests, beggars, the audience of a sumo match, the foreign settlement, and the group portrait of Alexander von Siebold and samurai. Rossier believed that Pompe van Meerdervoort's failures in photography were due to a lack of the necessary chemicals and so he provided Maeda with a letter of recommendation to procure photographic apparatus and chemicals from a source in Shanghai. Both Maeda and Furukawa bought lenses, chemicals and albumen paper through Rossier.At this time, Ueno Hikoma and Horie Kuwajir\u014d also received photographic instruction from Rossier. Apparently Ueno had originally intended to learn not only the practice of photography but also the manufacture of cameras.

When an apparent terrorist hijack attempt blows a hole in the (Boeing 747) airliner, Terry is sucked out to his death, and the terrorists parachute out of the same hole, taking Leedy with them. Ex-DEA agent and renegade skydiver Ty Moncrief (Gary Busey) is the mastermind behind the attack, which culminated in the first ever parachute jump from a commercial jet at 30,000 feet. Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer in Washington DC so Ty can auction off the names of undercover agents to drug cartels worldwide. Ty has scheduled this to be accomplished during an Independence Day parachute exhibition and fireworks display, which is the one day every year when security is loosened around the airspace above Washington DC. Pete believes that the assault may have been an elaborate prison break meant to free Leedy. However, the FBI declares that sneaking a parachute through airport security is impossible, and that parachuting at the jet's altitude and speed is not survivable. A devastated Pete is blamed for overreacting to the incident, and forced to turn in his badge. Undeterred, Pete consults a U.S. Navy High-altitude military parachuting instructor who confirms that he and his team have parachuted from that height and speed, but also states that the high-density metal rings in the parachutes would not pass airport metal detectors and that the operation required either rare skills or suicidal recklessness. The instructor believes the world class skydiver Dominic Jagger (Luca Bercovici) could perform the jump, but does not know his current whereabouts. Pete is instead referred to Jagger's reckless ex-wife, ex-con Jessie Crossman (Yancy Butler) - who is unaware that Jagger is part of Ty's crew.

Meshuggah's experimentation, stylistic variation and changes during its career cross several musical subgenres. Heavy metal subgenres experimental metal or avant-garde metal are umbrella terms that enable description of the career of the band in general. Extreme metal crosses both thrash metal and death metal (or technical death metal), which are at root of the sound of Meshuggah's music, which has also been described as groove metal. The band has also been labelled as math metal and progressive metal. Meshuggah also incorporates elements of experimental jazz. In its review of Nothing, Allmusic describes Meshuggah as \"masterminds of cosmic calculus metal\u2014call it Einstein metal if you want\". Meshuggah's early output was also considered alternative metal. Meshuggah creates a recognizable sonic imprint and distinct style.Trademarks and characteristics that define Meshuggah's sound and songwriting include polyrhythms, polymetered riff cycles, rhythmic syncopation, rapid key and tempo changes and neo-jazz chromatics. Hagstr\u00f6m notes that \"it doesn't really matter if something is hard to play or not. The thing is, what does it do to your mind when you listen to it?

In December 1775, Cletus Moyer is a free black Northerner in colonial America, working with a pre-Underground Railroad network to help slaves escape captivity. In the days just prior to Christmas, a group of bounty hunters led by Hattie Carraway captures Moyer near the Parker plantation in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. Because of his capture, dozens of slaves who have already left their plantations in escape attempts are in danger of being captured as well. Moyer implores two slaves from the nearby Reynolds plantation to take his place: Kunta Kinte, a Mandinka in his mid-twenties who was captured in what is now the Gambia, and Fiddler, an elderly man who was born into slavery. Kunta is eager to help (and to escape himself), but Fiddler is unwilling, fearful of the consequences if they are caught. After an unsuccessful slave revolt elsewhere in the colony, Moyer and two slaves are hanged by Carraway's men on Christmas Eve, prompting Fiddler to set aside his fear and help Kunta lead the runaway slaves to freedom. Although the pair successfully leads the runaways that night to their next stop on the escape route (a boat waiting at the river) there is only room for one of them, and since neither one wants to go without the other, they both decide to stay.  That choice forces them to return to the Parker plantation and manufacture an excuse for their temporary absence.

The new single from that album \"Travelin' Soldier\", a sensitive depiction of a soldier's life during the Vietnam War era, and the young woman who waited for him, finding he was killed in battle, had peaked at #1 on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs Chart. The film then cuts to a scene from the Dixie Chicks' March 10, 2003 concert at the Shepherd's Bush Empire Theatre in London, England. The atmosphere in the European audience is of dramatic opposition to the announcement from United States President George W. Bush's authorization of the invasion of Iraq.  Approximately 1 million people had recently demonstrated in London against the impending war. During the introduction to their song \"Travelin' Soldier\", Natalie Maines, a Texas native, says:  The Guardian, a major English newspaper, published Maines' statement as simply \"Just so you know, we're ashamed the President of the United States is from Texas.\" Shortly thereafter, the U.S. media picked up the story and controversy erupted. Conservative groups in the U.S. rallied against the Dixie Chicks and a firestorm of anger and criticism followed. The film shows the band's reaction to the open hostility, political and corporate backlash, and physical threats directed at the group. The band did not expect such a strong reaction, and they are unsure if they should \"shut up and sing\", apologize, or stand by their convictions and let more sparks fly.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe answer is:\n"}], "response": "Bush"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \"|||||\".

In actuality, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years. Tough border enforcement in the U.S. has led to the family breakups, with nearly 2,000 children being sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials. The regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders finally introduced Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen after 5 p.m., and she defended the administration's \"zero-tolerance\" policy that is breaking up families at the southwestern U.S. border. Nielsen forcefully pushed back at the negative media coverage, asserting that what U.S. authorities are doing is properly enforcing the law. \"What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law,\" she said. Asked about critics accusing the administration of using children as \"pawns\" to demand legislative actions from Congress, the DHS secretary replied, \"I say that is a very cowardly response,\" adding it is clearly within Congress' power \"to make the laws and change the laws.

The Gloucester County School Board is trying to prevent Gavin Grimm from using the bathroom that matches his gender identity when school resumes later this year, saying it will \"put parents' constitutional rights in jeopardy.'' Grimm sued the school district last year for the right to use the boys\u2019 restroom after the school board enacted a policy limiting bathroom use to the one corresponding with a person\u2019s biological sex rather than the gender with which the student identifies. Grimm was born female but identifies as male. \"Depriving parents of any say over whether their children should be exposed to members of the opposite biological sex, possibly in a state of full or complete undress, in intimate settings deprives parents of their right to direct the education and upbringing of their children,'' attorneys for the school board wrote. The ACLU, which is defending Grimm, has argued that forcing him to use the girls' bathroom is a violation of Title IX and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The issue is one that has been hotly debated in schools, courts and state legislatures across the U.S. The Obama administration in May directed the nation\u2019s public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity or risk losing their federal funding. Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration. The school board wants the Supreme Court to put Grimm's district court case on hold until the justices decide whether to review the appeals court decision. The board says it plans to file its petition for Supreme Court review by late August. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Kinsella, examines the tension between Native Canadians and Anglos in Canada from a Native perspective. Silas Crow, who lives on a Northern Ontario reserve, wants to take a mechanic's course in Toronto with his friend Frank Fencepost. But before he can enroll, the teen must write a short narrative describing his home. The film is a series of alternatively poignant vignettes from Crow's narrative.For anyone who has never lived within the boundaries of a Native Reservation anywhere in America, life on a Reservation is quite different from a regular town or city anywhere else, and this superb film will give you a glimpse into \"the life\". The teenagers deal with everything from relationships to trying to find their place in this world today; but when you are from a Native Reservation, fitting in is harder than you may think. Life on the Reservation is pretty much private among its members, and when one of their own marries a white lawyer, tension is felt - for the pain of having your girlfriend get married to a white man while you were away in prison. As if spending time in prison wasn't bad enough, rumours about your criminal life as a con circulate among the Reservation's members and about the girl who decides not to wait for you. After coming back, he's trying to decide which way to go in life, all the while dealing with his pain and frustrations in his new life outside the prison's walls. I don't want to say any more about this. It's a film that touches real life, no matter what culture you may be from.

Fogarty explains that a strange aircraft has been found at the pole, Hendry is put in charge of the recovery mission. Remembering the earlier conversation he asks if Scott can fly up with the recovery team.Arriving at the pole they meet with the scientists who are excited about the potential of the find. Hendry catches up with a science assistant Nikki Nicholson (Margaret Sheridan). It is clear from their encounter they have an extensive social past.Nikki introduces Hendry to Dr. Arthur Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite) leader of the scientist based at the north pole. Carrington tells Hendry the crashed aircraft is located about 48 miles from the base. When the plane crashed instruments recorded an explosion and magnetic flux disturbance that indicates the plane weighs approximately 20,000 tons.Hendry suggests that, given the recorded weight of the vessel, they must be dealing with a meteor. Carrington, however, shows him a number of radar tracks that show the object change course and speed a number of times before crashing.The expedition flies to the location to begin to unravel the mystery, as they approach the reported location the aircraft's compass begins to malfunction then Geiger counters begin registering erratic levels of radiation. Finally they see a teardrop-shaped area in the snow.Arriving at the actual crash site they realize whatever landed was so hot that it melted enough snow to sink down so that only a stabilizer fin is protruding from the ice. To establish the actual size of the craft the team slowly spreads out over the object.

There are reports of the chimps being beaten by the animal trainers based on eye witness accounts, a brief conversation with the trainers, and observations of 5 of the chimps after they were taken to a sanctuary after filming ended.

The \"prep\", Steve, is still bitter after his best friend Jamie, the \"jock\", had sex with Lisa, a girl with whom Steve was smitten and even took to their senior prom. After Steve and his friends Joey, Patrick, and A.J. harass the \"tranny\", Sam, they are chastised by Jamie. This leads to a brawl between Steve's team and Jamie's. Lisa breaks up the fight by dropping a bowling ball on Steve's foot just as Steve is about to kick Jamie again. Egerton, brandishing a shotgun, tells the teenagers to leave and they can continue their tournament the following night. Lisa, having forgot her purse in the arcade, returns to find Steve and his friends waiting for her. Steve proceeds to violently rape Lisa while the others watch. Egerton is oblivious to Lisa's cries for help, as he is downstairs cleaning up the mess the teenagers made. After he is finished raping Lisa, Steve leaves the room. While Steve is gone, A.J. anally rapes Lisa on the pool table; then it's Joey who abuses her. Patrick, who believed the three were only going to \"scare\" Lisa, refuses to participate in the rape. Steve returns with a bowling pin and prepares to insert it into Lisa before Patrick intervenes. Steve retorts by giving Patrick the pin and ordering him to do it himself. Patrick refuses to do so at first but complies when Steve threatens to do the same to him. In the end Patrick penetrates Lisa with the bowling pin as she screams in pain. The four leave Lisa on the pool table, naked and barely conscious. The following night, the two groups arrive at the bowling alley to continue their tournament.

Question: Where were Chiyo and sister Satsu sent to? Movie plot title: Memoirs of a Geisha Movie plot: Chiyo was the second daughter of a poor fisherman in Yoroido and a curiosity in her village - her eyes were blue (in the novel they were blue-grey). Ser father was old and her mother terminally ill; thus the parents were persuaded to sell their daughters for a more secured life. Chiyo and sister Satsu were promptly sent to Gion(geisha district) right away. Auntie decides to keep her in the Nitta Okiya, but rejects her sister. Satsu is then sent to a common brothel in the Miyagawa-Cho district to become a prostitute.Chiyo spent her first few years in the okiya working as a maid and planning her escape. Hatsumomo, the star of the okiya and one of the most beautiful and popular geishas at the time, sensed that she was going to be a threat and set out to eliminate her. She and Korin forced Chiyo to ruin a kimono(which belonged to Hatsumomo's most hated rival in Gion, Mameha). The next day, Auntie half-heartedly beat her as punishment for the ruined kimono since she didn't want Mother or Granny getting their hands on her. She also warns her against trusting Hatsumomo because she'll ruin her in a second. As a reward for ruining Mameha's kimono, Hatsumomo finally told her that her sister is in the Miyagawa-Cho district under the brother home, Tatsuyo and arranged for them to meet. The sisters decided that Chiyo would sneak out of the okiya by walking on top of the neighbouring roofs, meet up with Satsu, and then they would escape together. Her attempt failed as she fell off one of the roofs, and her sister went on without her. Auntie was infuriated at Chiyo for not heeding her warning to keep clear. While she was recovering from her injuries, she received a letter informing her that both of her parents have died. Now she is all alone in the world.Mother (the madam) was furious with Chiyo's rebellious behaviour and decided not to raise her as a geisha, but as a maid. On a maid wage, she will never be able to pay off her contract and leave the okiya.

The younger child Laser (Josh Hutcherson) wants to find his sperm donor father but has to be 18 to do so. He implores his 18-year-old sister, Joni (Mia Wasikowska), to contact the sperm bank which identifies Paul (Mark Ruffalo) as the donor. The three meet. Joni is impressed by his bohemian lifestyle, and Paul becomes enthusiastic about being in their lives. Joni swears her brother to secrecy as she does not want to upset their mothers. However, Jules and Nic find out and invite Paul over to dinner. When Jules reveals she has a landscape business, Paul asks her to transform his back garden. Jules agrees, although Nic does not like the idea. While working for Paul, Jules likes that he appreciates her work in contrast to Nic who, Jules feels, never supported her career. Jules impulsively kisses Paul one afternoon, and they end up in bed together, beginning an affair. Jules and the kids start spending more time with Paul. Nic believes Paul undermines her authority over the children by, for example, giving Joni a ride on his motorcycle\u00e2\u0080\u0094which Nic has forbidden\u00e2\u0080\u0094and by suggesting she give Joni more freedom.

Before dying, Charles takes cover inside a toy store, finding boxes of talking \"Good Guy\" dolls and then uses a voodoo ritual to transfer his soul into one of the dolls. The store is then struck by lightning and it burns to the ground.Later that morning, 6-year-old Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) tells his widowed mother Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks) that he wants a Good Guy doll for his birthday. Unable to afford the full price, Karen buys a stolen doll from a street peddler, which is the same doll into which Charles Lee Ray had earlier transferred his soul.That night, as Andy is playing with the doll who has introduced himself as \"Chucky\" Karen's friend, Maggie Peterson (Dinah Manoff), who is babysitting Andy, scolds him for turning on the evening news and placing Chucky in front of the TV. When Andy tries to deny the accusation, she doesn't believe him and sends him to bed. Maggie is later violently struck with a hammer by an unseen figure and falls out of the apartment kitchen window to her death. Andy, when questioned, insists that Chucky has revealed himself to be alive and that he killed Maggie.The next day, Andy visits the house of Eddie Caputo (Neil Giuntoli), Charles Lee Ray's accomplice, who had betrayed him.

Question: Who made Archer's death look like a suicide? Movie title: The Kennel Murder Case Movie plot: Philo Vance's dog does not make it into the final of the Long Island Kennel Club's dog show. Fellow competitor Archer Coe (Robert Barrat) is disappointed, having hoped to savor a victory over Vance. Coe is found dead the next morning in his bedroom, locked from the inside. District Attorney Markham (Robert McWade) and Police Sergeant Heath (Eugene Pallette) assume it was suicide, because he was shot through the head and was found holding a pistol. Vance is not convinced. He soon finds evidence that Coe was murdered. Coroner Dr. Doremus (Etienne Girardot) determines the victim died of a stab wound. There is no shortage of suspects; Coe was very much disliked. His niece Hilda Lake (Mary Astor) resented her uncle's tight control of her finances and jealousy of any men who showed interest in her. Her boyfriend, Sir Thomas MacDonald (Paul Cavanagh), suspected Coe of killing his dog to ensure winning the competition. Raymond Wrede (Ralph Morgan), the dead man's secretary, was in love with Miss Lake, but had been laughed at when he sought Coe's support. Coe's next door neighbor and lover Doris Delafield (Helen Vinson) had been cheating on him with Eduardo Grassi (Jack La Rue). When Coe found out, he canceled a contract to sell his collection of Chinese artworks to the Milan museum for which Grassi worked. Liang (James Lee), the cook, had worked long, hard and illegally to help Coe amass his collection. He warned his employer against the proposed sale and was fired as a result. Even Coe's own brother Brisbane (Frank Conroy) despised Coe. Finally Gamble (Arthur Hohl), the head servant, had concealed his criminal past. Brisbane Coe becomes Vance's prime suspect. His alibi of taking a train at the time of the murder is disproved. When he is found dead in a closet, Vance is both puzzled and enlightened. Among Brisbane's effects, Vance finds a book titled Unsolved Murders; a bookmarked page details a method of using string to lock a door through the keyhole without leaving a trace.

Movie title: Bad Kids Go to Hell Movie plot: A SWAT team barges into a school library to find a student holding an axe and surrounded by savaged bodies, before the film goes back eight hours previously. Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt) conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention. After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. They all try to break out of the library, but they are sealed in. Behaving mischievous, Veronica hides Megan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having a shortness of breath and dying before it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s found.

I checked in at the front desk-first on the right side of the counter, then, I shifted from right to left down the counter:  Video-Front Desk & Greeter:  https://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=10150494188326969  These people informed me that since I am an owner, I will receive my choice of either a free breakfast or free lunch, compliments of Grandview Resort.  The woman on the right side of the counter checked me in, took my credit card information, and gave me my credit card type room key.  The lady who initially checked me in said if I want to use the condo safe, I have to pay $10.00 PER DAY?  Also, there is NO Internet access, unless I want to pay $25.00 per day?!  Are you kidding me???  Then, shifting to my left of the counter, the man gave me my Grandview Resort parking pass permit.  After the man gave me my parking pass, the other woman asked me would I rather have complimentary show tickets, gambling chips or $100.00 USD.  I opted for the latter:  $100.00 USD, since I do not gamble and I do not like glam Lost Wages shows-too boring for me.   Shifting to the left again, I ask another front desk woman for directions driving to Nellis AFB.  The woman prints out the directions for me.  I exit and drive from the Grandview Resort Front Desk to the Primrose Building #2 . . . something felt amiss after leaving the Front Desk.  It just didn't feel right-my instincts were ringing an alarm inside my head.   O=:-/  Oh-oh . . . When I hear an alarm going off inside my head-something always warns me the situation I am in isn't right.  I park my car in front of the Primrose Building #2.  I couldn't find a luggage cart ANYWHERE, so I could bring my luggage up to my condo.  I looked down the halls, down the parking lot-NO luggage cart!  I schlep my two suitcases to the elevator.  I take the elevator to the eighth floor.  I insert my key into 808's main door-ok . . . that door opened.  Run my credit card room key at 808 A's door.  Door wouldn't open!  I knocked at 808B, my neighbor answers her door.    I told my neighbor my room key will not open my door & I just came from checking in at the front desk!  My neighbor lets me use her condo house phone calling the front desk notifying the front desk my room key will not open my condo's door.  I waited 30 MINUTES for a security manager to arrive at 808A giving me a new room key!  I'm sitting on the hallway floor waiting for this security manager to come to my condo door, so I can go inside my condo!  Mind you-I haven't even entered my condo and I am tired from driving SIX hours from Oxnard CA!  Come on!  What's taking that security manager so long giving me a new key?  Hallelujah!  Finally!  The security manager arrives and gives me two credit card room keys just in case the other key is defective.    I enter my 808A condo.  At first glance-the 1-bedroom condominium is nicely equipped with a full size kitchen, en suite bathroom with jacuzzi bath tub/full shower, two plasma TVs, apartment size washer & dryer, adequate, but small living room and dining room.  I began shooting footage of my condo's interior-Videos of Condo 808A:  1) https://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=10150494236646969&saved  2) https://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=10150494194781969&notif_t=video_processed  From the surface point of view, the condo appears clean, but the entire condo floor was dusty and dirty.  I swept ALL the floors and carpet with an old funky, yellow broom I found in the bedroom closet; I used a piece of cardboard as a dustpan in order picking up the dust and debris left on the floors and carpet-what a mess!   Upon further inspection, I found blood stains on the king size bed comforter, the refrigerator had food stains inside the refrigerator, and I found white splotches of whatever on the throw pillows on the living room sofa!  I have to agree with Tony C's Grandview Resort Review and horrific experience as 100% accurate:  http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hzH8N2G-qFXI40H1OFU2DQ  Furthermore, NEXT DAY-I waited 30 MINUTES stewing, waiting, sitting on one of the armchairs-STILL waiting to receive my free lunch voucher.  However, to my utter dismay-a sales rep approaches me at the Front Desk when I asked for my lunch voucher after waiting so long-45 MINUTES LATER; it's 12:30 PM.  That sales rep took me over to the South Point Casino and ate lunch with me!  Why is THIS man eating lunch with me?  I had NO IDEA I would be accompanied by a sales rep eating lunch, so I kept my cool and maintained a diplomatic stance.  This man ate FAST!  I am a slow eater. This man kept getting up from the table becoming very impatient waiting for me finishing eating my lunch!  Needless to say, I experienced a 4 1/2 hour ARDUOUS sales presentation telling them I don't want to buy anything; THEY MENTAL FLOSSED NOT HEARING ME!\n\n\nQ: positive\n\nA: I've been craving pizza and Rosati's seemed like the perfect place to satiate that need. We had a promotional discount for a thin crust pie with two toppings. Seemed like a great match for a Friday night.   Driving up we realized this was more of a joint to call ahead and take the pie home. No biggie tho, the pizza was delish! There are a few tables inside, with very basic fluorescent lighting and close proximity to the register . (There are a few iron wrought tables outside.  I may have missed if there were napkins or supplies there.)  The cashier asked if we had called ahead. (Super chipper and pleasant.) The toppings aren't listed on the wall so we stepped aside to review the menu. The wait time was approximately 20 minutes. Everyone was super helpful and nice.  I have no basis for comparison of a Chicago thin style crust pizza. I hail from New York. I can tell you this thin crust pizza was crunchy and cut into perfect squares and I very much enjoyed it.   My topping options were equally distributed underneath the cheese. (I went with pineapple and jalapenos). There weren't any goopy sections in the middle where the pie crust wasn't crispy. Yum!

Like putting butter on a burn or tilting your head back during a nosebleed, however, this is false.  Small wounds actually heal better in a moist environment, in which blood vessels regenerate faster and inflammation-causing cells multiply more slowly.  So, preventing scab formation actually aids the healing process.  It may be no surprise that the company behind Band-Aids promotes covering cuts and scrapes instead of airing them out, but they have science on their side. Sometimes the worst part of pulling away a bandage is not the sticky adhesive, but dried blood / scabbing that pulls away with the bandage and reopens the wound.  Proper preparation can make this less likely.  Stop the bleeding of a minor cut or scrape by applying pressure with gauze, a paper towel, a clean cloth, etc.  Apply gentle pressure for up to 15 minutes, until all bleeding has stopped. For a large cut or wound, an excessively dirty wound, or a wound that won't stop bleeding, get medical help. Rinse the area with clean water and gently clean the wound with soap and water.  Rinse again and pat dry with a clean cloth, etc.  Don't use hydrogen peroxide or one of those old wound cleaners your grandfather swore by -- just plain old soap and water. Hydrogen peroxide and iodine can irritate an injury. Antibiotic ointments have shown little evidence in helping wounds heal faster, but they do help keep the wound moist and make sticking less likely upon bandage removal.  That said, plain old petroleum jelly will provide the same moistening / lubricating benefit.  Apply a small dab only over the wound itself, so the bandage will stick where it should. Choose a bandage that is large enough so that the pad (the part that isn't sticky) covers the entire wound with a little room to spare.  Try not to touch the pad when applying to reduce infection chances.  Especially when wrapping a bandage around a finger (or a larger bandage wrap around an arm or leg), make it tight enough to stay in place and prevent a gap between pad and wound, but not so tight that it hampers blood flow.  If your finger tingles or turns purple-ish, it's too tight. Apply a new bandage if the old one gets saturated with water or dirty. If you need to apply a bandage to a hairy area -- for a man, an arm or leg, or even chest or back -- you may want to prevent the inevitable pain of the bandage being stuck to your hair by removing the hair first.  Use warm water, a fresh, clean razor, and don't shave over the wound itself. Unless you want to have patchy hairless spots along with your small scars, you probably should try the other bandage removal procedures discussed in this article before resorting to this step. Bandage removal is not just an annoyance -- some 1.5 million people in the U.S. annually, mostly infants and the elderly with sensitive skin, suffer scarring or irritation from bandage removal.  However, new bandages are being developed that sandwich a \u201cquick-release\u201d layer between the backing and dissolvable adhesive. So, perhaps painful bandage removals will be a thing of the past soon.\n++++++++++\nOne-sentence summary -- Don't avoid removing a bandage by not using one. Prepare wounds properly for bandaging. Consider moistening the wound to inhibit sticking. Cover the wound with a bandage. Get out your razor, if necessary. Have faith in medical science.\n\n\nIce baths may help you get a burst of energy or might help you improve your mood. However, they aren\u2019t appropriate for everyone, especially if you have an underlying health condition. Talk to your doctor about why you want to try cold therapy and if it\u2019s right for you. For instance, taking ice baths can be dangerous if you have a heart condition. Your doctor can help you determine if you have any risks that might make it harmful to take an ice bath. Don\u2019t fill up your tub because the ice and your body will raise the volume of the water. Turn on the faucet that controls the cold water and wait for the water to rise about halfway up the tub. Then, switch off the water faucet. Use cold water because warm water will melt your ice too quickly. Use store-bought ice or ice from your freezer, whichever is most convenient to you. Drop a few handfuls of ice in the tub, then check the temperature with a thermometer. Continue to add ice in small amounts until the water reaches about 68\u00a0\u00b0F (20\u00a0\u00b0C). If you like, it\u2019s okay to lower your temperature so that it\u2019s colder. However, don\u2019t lower it below 55\u00a0\u00b0F (13\u00a0\u00b0C), which can harm your skin or your health. Sit back against the back of your tub and try to enjoy your soak. Breathe slowly in and out, drawing the air deep into your lungs. You might also count your breaths to help you relieve any tension in your body. Set a timer for 5 minutes and try to stay in the bath until it goes off. Get out of the bath early if you feel too uncomfortable or feel like your heart is racing. Don\u2019t push your body further than it\u2019s ready to go. You can still get the benefits you want without soaking in a tub. Instead, stand under a cold shower for at least a minute. If you can stand it, stay under the water for a full 3 minutes. For a daily energy boost, end your morning shower with a blast of cold water. Take your bath or shower early in the morning to improve your mood for that day. If you like, take another bath or shower later in the day. Continue using it as long as you feel like it\u2019s helping you have more energy or to cope with your anxiety or depression. Cold therapy isn\u2019t a substitute for working with a therapist or taking medication for anxiety or depression. Don\u2019t stop any of your prescribed treatments unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay.\n++++++++++\nOne-sentence summary --\n"}], "response": "Check with your doctor before using cold therapy to treat yourself.

The composer Ned Rorem observed, \"He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual\"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, \"Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans ma\u00eetre with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today.\" Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, \"There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [du Printemps]. It was not progress.\" Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: \"You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music\".In his last years Poulenc observed, \"if people are still interested in my music in 50 years' time it will be for my Stabat Mater rather than the Mouvements perp\u00e9tuels.\" In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: \"both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites and Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias.\" At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as \"a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds.

A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press.

The first plane has 50, the second had 60, and the third has 40. An empty plane can go 600 MPH, but each passenger makes it go 2 MPH slower. What is their average speed?\n[Answer]The first plane goes 100 MPH slower than empty because 50 x 2 = 100. The first plane goes 500 MPH because 600 - 100 = 500. The second plane goes 120 MPH slower because 60 x 2 = 120. The second plane goes 480 because 600 - 120 = 480. The third plane goes 80 MPH slower because 40 x 2 = 80. The third plane goes 520 MPH because 600 - 80 = 520. The total speed is 1500 because 500 + 480 + 520 = 1500. Their average speed is 500 because 1500 / 3 = 500.

The Emperor (Chow Yun-fat) returns from his military campaign with his second son, Prince Jai (Jay Chou), in order to celebrate with his family. For three years, the Empress (Gong Li) has had an affair with her stepson, Crown Prince Wan (Liu Ye), who was born from the Emperor's first wife. Crown Prince Wan is not interested in the throne and wishes to run away with his secret lover, Jiang Chan (Li Man), the daughter of the Imperial Doctor. Meanwhile, Prince Jai (the Empress's first son), becomes worried over his mother' ill health and wonders at her sudden obsession with golden flowers. The Empress reveals that she is planning to overthrow the Emperor, who has been poisoning her. Prince Jai agrees to lead the Empress's soldiers. A mysterious woman informs the Empress that she is being poisoned with Persian Black Fungus, but immediately after making her report, Crown Prince Wan captures the woman and takes her to the Emperor. The woman identifies herself as Jiang Shi (Chen Jin), the wife of the Imperial Doctor. The Emperor is shocked when he sees her and decides not to punish her, in spite of having had her entire family killed shortly after his ascension. She reunites with her husband and daughter. The Emperor also decides to promote the Doctor to governor of the nearby province of Suzhou, so the Doctor and his family pack their things and set out. Crown Prince Wan is sad that the Doctor's daughter is leaving. He runs after their convoy and speaks to her, and learns that the Empress has woven ten thousands of scarves adorned with chrysanthemum motifs, sending them to a general of the imperial army afterwards.

I was leery about airport parking at first. I have never done it and heard bad things in general about it. We usually take some sort of shuttlemobile that picks us up at our house and drives us there like Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. We had 6 people in our group this time, so driving to the airport seemed more economical.   So I got this nifty Groupon a few months back and the deal seemed too good to be true. It wasn't. Everything and everyone met and exceeded my expectations.   We arrived, and they gave us our assigned parking spot right away. We parked in the covered spots. As soon as we exited the car, the van guy was already loading our luggage into the van. The van was clean and minty fresh. Nice and cool on an AZ summer day. The guy was a good driver and got us to the right gate quickly. They gave us a card with our space # and said to call if we arrive back after midnight.   As we were leaving the baggage claim area I called them and by the time we got to the waiting spot, the van was just pulling up. Now that's fast service! The guy quickly and courteously loaded our luggage, and when we got to our car, he even offered to load it into the car. What an awesome dude!   We paid the super nice lady on the way out, and she even gave us a voucher for a free car wash. How's that for service?   I was very happy with Blue Sky Airport Parking.

Dreams don't pay the bills, so he's ended up as the lead singer and guitarist of a blackened death metal band, \"Detroit Metal City.\" In stage costume he is Johannes Krauser II, rumored to be a terrorist demon from hell, to have killed and raped his parents, to wield his giant death penis with abandon, and other menacing tales being said about him after each public performance. The songs of DMC often encourage the audience to engage in immoral and illegal behavior, such as rape or murder, or tell of Krauser's exploits with similar actions, in a parody of the genre.Negishi despises DMC and all that it stands for, but he can't walk away as he has a talent to play the psychotic frontman of the band. Negishi is under his meager exterior a rageaholic and also is very skilled in his guitar play. Further, he feels obligation to the rest of the band and his label and even if he manages to escape, he is invariably roped back in by the manager of the band's label. The Krauser persona also functions as an outlet to vent his frustration over his failing personal career, which has not advanced beyond him being a street musician. Playing his music in the street earns him nothing but the disapproval of bystanders over his cheesy pop songs.Negishi is envious of the popularity DMC and his Krauser persona enjoy in contrast to the music he actually wants to play being ridiculed, which in turn leads to his Krauser persona coming out more often, which leads to Krauser's popularity growing. The series explores the futile attempts of Negishi to break this vicious circle, escape his DMC persona and become a successful pop musician.\n\n\nQuestion: Build a movie plot around this: Who is given to the vampire so the others can survive? Greta\nAnswer: In 1921, German director F. W. Murnau takes his cast and crew on-location in Czechoslovakia to shoot Nosferatu, an unauthorized version of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula. Murnau keeps his team in the dark about their schedule and the actor playing the vampire Count Orlok. It is left to the film's other main actor, Gustav von Wangenheim, to explain that the lead is an obscure German theater performer named Max Schreck, who is a character actor. To involve himself fully in his role, Schreck will only appear amongst the cast and crew in makeup, and will never break character.After filming scenes in a studio with leading actress Greta Schroeder, who is displeased about leaving Berlin, Murnau's team travels to the remote inn where they will be staying and shooting further scenes. The landlady becomes distressed at Murnau removing crucifixes around the inn, and the cameraman, Wolfgang Muller, falls into a strange, hypnotic state. Gustav discovers a bottle of blood amongst the team's food supplies, and Murnau delivers a caged ferret in the middle of the night.One night, Murnau rushes his team up to an old Slovak castle for the first scene with the vampire. Schreck appears for the first time, and his appearance and behavior impress and disturb them. The film's producer, Albin Grau, suspects that Schreck is not a German theater actor, and is confused when Murnau tells him that he found Schreck in the castle. Soon after the completion of the scene, Wolf is found collapsed in a dark tunnel. Upon returning to the inn, the landlady appears frightened by his pale, weak appearance, and mutters \"Nosferatu\" while clutching at a rosary.Whilst filming a dinner scene between Gustav and Count Orlok, Murnau startles Gustav, making him cut his finger. Schreck reacts wildly at the sight of the blood, and tries drinking from Gustav's wound. The generator powering the lights fails and when the lights return, Schreck has pinned Wolf to the floor, apparently draining his blood. Albin orders filming ended for the night, and the crew...\n\n\n[Q]: Build a movie plot around this: Who plans to capture Tarzan ?

In the 1960s, O'Barry helped capture and train the five wild dolphins who shared the role of \"Flipper\" in the hit television series of the same name. The show, very popular, fueled widespread public adoration of dolphins, influencing the development of marine parks that included dolphins in their attractions. After one of the dolphins, in O'Barry's opinion, committed a form of suicide in his arms by closing her blowhole voluntarily in order to suffocate, O'Barry came to see the dolphin's captivity and the dolphin capture industry as a curse, not a blessing. Days later, he was arrested off the island of Bimini, attempting to cut a hole in the sea pen in order to set free a captured dolphin.[7] Since then, according to the film, O'Barry has dedicated himself full-time as an advocate on behalf of dolphins around the world. After meeting with O'Barry, Psihoyos and his crew travel to Taiji, Japan, a town that appears to be devoted to dolphins and whales. In a nearby, isolated cove, however, surrounded by wire fences and \"Keep Out\" signs, an activity takes place that the townspeople attempt to hide from the public. In the cove, a group of Taiji fishermen engage in dolphin drive hunting. The film states that the dolphin hunt is, in large part, motivated by the tremendous revenue generated for the town by selling some of the captured dolphins, female bottlenose dolphins, to aquariums and marine parks and killing the majority of the rest. The dolphins that are not sold into captivity are then slaughtered in the cove and the meat is sold in supermarkets. According to the evidence presented in the film, the local Japanese government officials are involved in the hiding of the hunting, and the Japanese public is not fully aware of the hunt and the marketing of dolphin meat. The film states that the dolphin meat contains dangerously high levels of mercury and interviews two local...???\noutput answer: The Cove\n\ninput question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In 1979, Deputy Sheriff Jack Lamb (Kyle Chandler) of Lillian, Ohio, and his 14-year-old[3] son Joe (Joel Courtney), mourn the death of his mother Elizabeth (Caitriona Balfe) in a steel mill accident.[4] Jack blames her co-worker, Louis Dainard (Ron Eldard), as she was covering his shift while he recovered from a hangover, and all Joe has left is a locket that belonged to her, that he now holds on to. Four months later, Joe's best friend Charles Kaznyk (Riley Griffiths) decides to make a low-budget zombie movie for an international film competition. Charles enlists the help of Preston Scott (Zach Mills), Martin Read (Gabriel Basso), and Cary McCarthy (Ryan Lee), as well as Dainard's daughter, Alice (Elle Fanning). Though their fathers would be furious, Joe and Alice become infatuated with each other. Charles has them film a scene at a train depot at midnight. While they are rehearsing, a train approaches, and Charles has them start filming as the train passes to add 'production value'. While filming, Joe witnesses a pickup truck drive onto the tracks and ram the train, causing a massive derailment that destroys the train, the depot and the surrounding area, and the friends barely survive. The children investigate the wreck and find crates full of strange white cubes, then discover the truck's driver is Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman), their biology teacher. Woodward, barely alive, warns them at gunpoint to forget what they saw that night, or else they and their parents will be killed. The children flee the scene just as a convoy from the local U.S. Air Force base, led by Col. Nelec (Noah Emmerich), arrive at the scene. Nelec discovers an empty Super 8mm film box, and assumes the event was purposely captured on camera. While Joe and Charles wait for their film to be developed, the town experiences strange events: All the dogs run away, several townspeople go missing, the electrical power fluctuates and electronic items from all over are stolen.

The clock on the dashboard reads 11:14 p.m. Suddenly, as he drives under an overpass, something smashes across the windshield, causing him to skid off the road. He stops by a deer crossing sign and gets out to inspect the damage, and finds a body with a badly mutilated face lying close to his car. When he sees another car approaching, he panics and drags the body out of sight. The car pulls up next to him, and the driver, Norma (Barbara Hershey), assumes that he hit a deer. She offers to call the police over Jack's protests, insisting that it's no trouble because she has a new cell phone that she 'never uses' and because she is friends with the chief of police. Norma offers Jack a ride to her house to wait for the police, but he declines. When she drives off, Jack decides to hide the body in the trunk of his car. He gets back into the car to pull away, but a police officer pulls up behind him. Officer Hannagan (Clark Gregg) speaks with Jack, and noting his odd behavior, asks him if he would submit to a breathalyzer test. Jack requests a sobriety test instead, which Hannagan administers. When the officer checks with dispatch, he finds that Jack's license has been revoked for driving under the influence. Hannagan tells Jack that he is under arrest and that his car will be impounded. When he finds the body in the trunk, Hannagan handcuffs Jack with a cable tie and tells the 2 people already in the back of the cruiser, Duffy (Shawn Hatosy) and Buzzy (Hilary Swank), to move over so that Jack will fit. While Hannagan argues with Buzzy, who refuses to move over, Jack is able to pull his pocketknife out of his pocket, cut the cable tie, and escape. Hannagan pursues, leaving the cruiser door open,...???\noutput answer:"}], "response": "11:14"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Americans may become accustomed to the political turmoil swirling around President Donald Trump, but it remains an open question whether that turmoil will ultimately help or hurt Trump and his Republican allies, especially in an election year. Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania \u2014 a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \"assurances\" that firing Mueller was \"not even under consideration.\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. \"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson. That, in turn, raised the prospect of more administration changes. Question: When did the president tweet? Options: - after firing his counsel - before congratulating Putin - not enough information - during the midterms\nbefore congratulating Putin\n\n\n(Question)\nRead the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, one of the other places I didn\u2019t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it\u2019s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don\u2019t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C\u2019est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27\u20ac compared to 12\u20ac for adults and 10\u20ac for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5\u20ac. It\u2019s a nice cool 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above. It is damp in places and the ground can be slippery so watch your step as you walk.

Context: U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator Lindsey Graham have joined a growing chorus of Republican leaders to disavow comments by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump about the Mexican heritage of a judge in a class-action lawsuit against Trump University. Questioned Tuesday about Trump's comments, Ryan said \"I regret those comments he made. Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of racism.\" But he did not retract his endorsement of Trump, made last week, and he said he does not believe Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton is \"the answer.\" Ryan made his comments during an appearance at a women's shelter in Washington, D.C. In a New York Times interview, Graham, also a former presidential candidate, said Trump's remarks were \"the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,\" referring to the ultra-conservative senator of the 1950s who fueled fears of widespread communist subversion in the United States. Graham also suggested that Republicans who have endorsed Trump reconsider their choice. \"If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,\" he said. The backlash appears to be mounting against the candidate, who has repeatedly said he believes U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \"Mexican heritage,\" would not rule fairly in the case charging Trump with fraud. Curiel is an American who was born and raised in the Midwestern U.S. state of Indiana. U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who has criticized Trump on multiple occasions during the campaign, tweeted: \"Saying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of 'racism.''' Sasse was joined Monday by two former rivals for the Republican nomination. Ohio Governor John Kasich tweeted that Trump's offensive \"is flat out wrong.'' Trump, Kasich wrote, should \"apologize to Judge Curiel & try to unite this country.'' Question: Why did Graham suggest Republicans who have endorsed Trump reconsider?

The British thus became masters of east India (Bengal, Bihar, Orissa) \u2013 a prosperous region with a flourishing agriculture, industry and trade. This led to a large amount of children being forced into labour due to the increasing need of cheap labour to produce large numbers of goods. Many multinationals often employed children because that they can be recruited for less pay, and have more endurance to utilise in factory environments. Another reason many Indian children were hired was because they lack knowledge of their basic rights, they did not cause trouble or complain, and they were often more trustworthy. The innocence that comes with childhood was utilised to make a profit by many and was encouraged by the need for family income.\".

The Parisian Jewish community was victim of persecution, alternating expulsions and returns, until France became the first country in Europe to emancipate its Jewish population during the French Revolution. Although 75% of the Jewish population in France survived the Holocaust during World War II, half the city's Jewish population perished in Nazi concentration camps, while some others fled abroad. A large migration of North Africa Sephardic Jews settled Paris in the 1960s, and represent most of the Paris Jewish community today. There are currently 83 synagogues in the city; The Marais-quarter Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue, built in 1913 by architect Hector Guimard, is a Paris landmark.\".

Chief among these relate to the directional characteristics (as depicted in the antenna's radiation pattern) and the resulting gain. Even in omnidirectional (or weakly directional) antennas, the gain can often be increased by concentrating more of its power in the horizontal directions, sacrificing power radiated toward the sky and ground. The antenna's power gain (or simply \"gain\") also takes into account the antenna's efficiency, and is often the primary figure of merit.\".

By the end of 1940 significant improvements had been made in the Underground and in many other large shelters. Authorities provided stoves and bathrooms and canteen trains provided food. Tickets were issued for bunks in large shelters to reduce the amount of time spent queuing.

Ten years later, Max's brother volcanologist Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) is visited by Max's son, Trevor's 13-year-old nephew Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson).

Hannah offers to help them climb the volcano. While the group is hiking up the volcano, a lightning storm forces them to take shelter in a cave. The cave entrance collapses, having them trapped in what appears to be an abandoned mine. The trio then rides on out-of-control mine carts, in which the tracks start to branch-off in three ways.

Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him.  As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \"What did you do that for?,\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does.

Sheilah Graham sails from England to the U.S. and meets with a newspaper  editor John Wheeler, telling him of her royal lineage and many connections. He hires her to write a column, and when its blunt and gossipy nature increases its popularity, Sheilah also is offered her own radio program. She meets acclaimed author F. Scott Fitzgerald at a party at the home of humorist Bob Carter, her friend. An immediate attraction is formed, although Scott is still married to wife Zelda, who has been institutionalized. To meet financial obligations, Scott has accepted a position in Hollywood writing film scripts, expressing the belief that his novels are no longer of interest. His excessive drinking affects his mood and his work. Scott is haunted by the memories of Zelda and the success and fun they had together. He learns that a play is being produced in Pasadena based on one of his stories and takes Sheilah to see it, only to discover that it is a production by high school students, some of whom are unaware that the writer is even still alive. Sheilah copes with his growing alcoholism and tries to leave him until Scott sends a goodbye note, sounding suicidal. She confesses to him that her own past haunts her, everything she claimed to be being a lie: Sheilah actually is a girl from the London slums. She appeals to Scott to write another book, but after he sends in the first four chapters, Scott receives a publisher's letter of rejection.

Review: I've ordered Ked's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality. The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $5. No support, thin canvas - just junk. I'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe. I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to. No support, no padding, more narrow, thinner canvas. I've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference. Save your money. You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $5-$8, it just won't have a Keds tag. This is no longer the bargain it once was. Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator.

This is unlikely to be the last North Korean attempt to launch such a missile and once their engineers figure out the problem, they will go back to the launching pad. No one knows how long this process will take, but it could be as little as a few months and North Korean engineers will want to save their jobs and more by fixing the problem quickly. This continued development of missiles should worry all Americans as over the past few years North Korea has acquired enough nuclear material to build a small arsenal of nuclear weapons and while they cannot yet miniaturize a nuclear warhead to fit on a long-range missile, they are clearly pursuing a system capable of holding American cities at risk of attack. Their success is only a matter of time unless Pyongyang can be convinced their course is futile.\n\nOver the long run, how can Americans be sure that some future \"test\" missile won't be fitted with a nuclear weapon and targeted on a US city? The short answer is they can't. But through a straightforward policy of deterrence we can eliminate any thought in North Korean minds that they can attack the United States and survive. President Bush should declare that any offensive missile fired at the United States or its allies in the region from North Korea would be an act of war requiring a swift and massive response. Such a clear, strong statement would reassure our allies and remove the incentive for North Korea to pursue its missile programs. Moreover, attaching the same consequences to any sales of long-range missiles to hostile states would eliminate the profit motive for North Korea . This is what Kennedy did when Russia deployed missiles to Cuba, and what Truman, Eisenhower, and Reagan did during the height of the cold war. The result helped prevent the use of Soviet nuclear weapons during the cold war and deterred China from similar pursuits. But the current uneven and confused response by the United States has led to a weakening of deterrence in East Asia and has allowed the dangerous belief to take root in North Korean minds, that it can successfully pursue its aggressive strategy. Nothing could be more dangerous for stability in the region.\n\nWhile the United States has moved to support additional sanctions by Japan and urged South Korea to penalize North Korea in response to the missile tests, this falls far short of the severe consequences that had been threatened before the launch. U.S. allies and adversaries alike have to know that Washington will not stand by and let hostile nations threaten global security. To date, North Korea has succeeded in developing a significant nuclear arsenal and in advancing its missile programs with only a minimum of economical and political consequences. This only encourages more provocative behavior in the future.\n\nSuch a stark recommendation may sound harsh and smack of the nuclear dangers that permeated the cold war -- a comparison the White House has rejected. But deterrence (and a lot of luck) prevented a nuclear conflict during the cold war and can help prevent unpredictable states from making the wrong decision. North Korea needs to be reminded that the US deterrent remains strong and President Bush needs to express just that in the strongest possible terms. Anything less invites North Korea to continue along its dangerous path.\n\nJon B.

However, the mechanism through which insulin signalling is impaired in the endothelium of diabetic individuals remains unclear. In this work, we have evaluated the role of the AGE precursor methylglyoxal (MGO) in generating endothelial insulin resistance both in cells and in animal models.', 'Time course experiments were performed on mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs) incubated with 500 \u03bcmol/l MGO. The glyoxalase-1 inhibitor S-p-bromobenzylglutathione-cyclopentyl-diester (SpBrBzGSHCp2) was used to increase the endogenous levels of MGO. For the in vivo study, an MGO solution was administrated i.p. to C57BL/6 mice for 7 weeks.', 'MGO prevented the insulin-dependent activation of the IRS1/protein kinase Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) pathway, thereby blunting nitric oxide (NO) production, while extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) activation and endothelin-1 (ET-1) release were increased by MGO in MAECs. Similar results were obtained in MAECs treated with SpBrBzGSHCp2. In MGO- and SpBrBzGSHCp2-exposed cells, inhibition of ERK1/2 decreased IRS1 phosphorylation on S616 and rescued insulin-dependent Akt activation and NO generation, indicating that MGO inhibition of the IRS1/Akt/eNOS pathway is mediated, at least in part, by ERK1/2. Chronic administration of MGO to C57BL/6 mice impaired whole-body insulin sensitivity and induced endothelial insulin resistance.\nAnswer: MGO impairs the action of insulin on the endothelium both in vitro and in vivo, at least in part through an ERK1/2-mediated mechanism. These findings may be instrumental in developing novel strategies for preserving endothelial function in diabetes.\nA:"}], "response": "Does methylglyoxal impair endothelial insulin sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo?"}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "The State of Chile hereby delivers this consolidated document, which includes its 15th to\u00a018th periodic reports, in accordance with article 9, paragraph 1, of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.\n\nTranslate to French\n"}], "response": "L'\u00c9tat du Chili soumet le pr\u00e9sent document de synth\u00e8se - qui contient les 15e, 16e, 17e et\u00a018e\u00a0rapports p\u00e9riodiques- conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe\u00a01 de l'article\u00a09 de la Convention internationale sur l'\u00e9limination de toutes les formes de discrimination raciale."}, {"dialog_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Roots that spread out close to the surface, such as those of willows, can produce shoots and ultimately new plants. In the event that one of the systems is lost, the other can often regrow it. In fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf, as is the case with Saintpaulia, or even a single cell \u2013 which can dedifferentiate into a callus (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant.

However, this does not imply impulsive rambling: Nicholas Temperley writes that \"improvisation is designed for an audience, and its starting-point is that audience's expectations, which include the current conventions of musical form.\" The works for piano and orchestra, including the two concertos, are held by Temperley to be \"merely vehicles for brilliant piano playing ... formally longwinded and extremely conservative\". After the piano concertos (which are both early, dating from 1830), Chopin made no attempts at large-scale multi-movement forms, save for his late sonatas for piano and for cello; \"instead he achieved near-perfection in pieces of simple general design but subtle and complex cell-structure.\" Rosen suggests that an important aspect of Chopin's individuality is his flexible handling of the four-bar phrase as a structural unit.\nWho wrote that \"improvisation is designed for an audience\"?\nA: Nicholas Temperley\n\nQ: What is a question about this article?

Title: This book is terrible, but, sadly, I've read worse Review: Sally Wentworth always wrote very well, her prose attentive and skillful, but this book was bizarre. Hugo holds his wife Kate captive, thinking she lied about being a virigin and has now cheated on him. She's a virgin, of course, but he accuses her of being the sluttiest slut who ever did slut. Honestly, I think Hugo was turned on by the idea...but disgusted at himself for being turned on, so he takes his aggression out on the heroine/victim.This book is missing a critical piece in a romance novel: any semblance of romance. There is no communication, only accusation, abuse, torture, stubbornness, pride and outright stupidity. If the author had included some inkling of a love and affection between the two characters, some sort of true remorse or process of healing, perhaps it could have been redeemed.

Definition\nGiven a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.\nPart 2.

Since the state of Maine has no death penalty, he is given two consecutive life sentences and sent to the notoriously harsh Shawshank Prison. Andy always claims his innocence, but his cold and measured demeanor led many to doubt his word.During the first night, the chief guard, Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), savagely beats an overweight and newly arrived inmate because of his crying and hysterics. The inmate later dies in the infirmary because the prison doctor had left for the night. Meanwhile, Andy remained steadfast and composed.

Red has been in prison for several years having been given three consecutive life sentences for the murder of his wife and two others.About a month later, Andy approaches Red, who runs contraband inside the walls of Shawshank. He asks Red to find him a rock hammer, an instrument he claims is necessary for his hobby of rock collecting and sculpting. Though other prisoners consider Andy \"a really cold fish,\" Red sees something in Andy, and likes him from the start.
