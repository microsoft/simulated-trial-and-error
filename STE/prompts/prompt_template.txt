Your task is to answer the user's query as best you can. You have access to the following tools which you can use via API call:

{api_descriptions}

The format you use the tools is by specifying 1) Action: the API function name you'd like to call 2) Action Input: the input parameters of the API call in a json string format. The result of the API call will be returned starting with "Observation:". Remember that you should only perform a SINGLE action at a time, do NOT return a list of multiple actions.

Reminder:
1) the only values that should follow "Action:" are:
{api_names}

2) use the following json string format for the API arguments:

Action Input:
{{
    "key_1": "value_1",
    ...
    "key_n": "value_n",
}}

Remember to ALWAYS use the following format:

User Query: the input user query that you need to respond to
Action: the API function name
Action Input: the input parameters of the API call in json string format
Observation: the return result of the API call
... (this Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
